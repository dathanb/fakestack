    "body": "<p>One of the Kindle Touch <a href=\"http://kindleworld.blogspot.com/2013/03/kindle-news-kindle-touch-update-v5321.html\">updates</a> included a \"Time-to-Read\" feature.  It seems to be based loosely on how fast I turn the page.  I usually turn back to the cover when I start reading a new book and flip back to the start of the introduction or first chapter.  So the status usually says <code>1 min left in chapter</code> for a chapter or two.  I'm guessing the algorithm has determined that I have super-human reading speed.  Once I prove I don't, it becomes fairly accurate.</p>\n\n<p>But other times I sit on a page for several minutes when distracted by other things.  I would have assumed the calculation would show me taking much longer to finish chapters after doing that.  However, the reading time seems to be stable and fairly accurate after the initial weirdness.</p>\n\n<p>How does the algorithm work and why does each book have its own estimate?</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>For Kindles that use <a href=\"http://www.eink.com/technology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">E Ink displays</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E Ink's technology is commonly referred to as \"bistable\". What does this mean? Bistable means that the image on an E Ink screen will be retained even when all power sources are removed. In practice, this means that the display is consuming power only when something is changing. For example, when reading on an eReader, power is only needed when turning to a new page but no power is consumed by the display while reading the page. This is most noticeable when an eReader goes into sleep mode yet there is still an image being displayed. By contrast, with a traditional LCD, the display is needs to be refreshed around 30X per second, regardless of the whether anything new is being displayed. Bistability significantly reduces the power consumption of displays using E Ink and is a key reason eReaders have such long battery life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"Special Offers\" do change the screen and therefore cost a small amount of battery when the Kindle goes to sleep.  But Kindles without the ads also change the screen when going to the lock screen.  Depending on the exact nature of the image, it might be more or less expensive in terms of battery than whatever ad you might have received.</p>\n\n<p>For Kindle Fires, the ads are run on the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200671290\" rel=\"nofollow\">lock screen</a> and not when in sleep mode.  Again, the difference is just which image is displayed so the energy cost differential should be negligible.</p>\n\n<p>New ads for both platforms must be downloaded occasionally to replace the outdated ones stored somewhere on the device.  But the device only checks for new ads when you sync up, so there's no extra network connections being made.  I've left my WiFi connection off for weeks at a time and the ads just age out and go to a generic screensaver.  As soon as I sync, I start seeing new ads.  The device does not turn on a wireless connection unless you command it to.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, battery life shouldn't be a concern one way or another when deciding which configuration to buy.</p>\n",

That effectively removes the book from normal searches. We can't figure out what triggers the \"red flag\" and Amazon isn't saying. The cover art doesn't seem to be any better, worse, more suggestive, whatever. Covers are definitely tamer than directly competitive books. Nothing stands out for us in the book content. It's a case of \"If A, B, and C are fine, why did D get flagged?\"</p>\n\n<p>For anyone else who has encountered this phenomenon, have you come up with any insights?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOLLOWS:</p>\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, you can only see the ADULT tag via Amazon's API. You won't see it on the book's listing on Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>To see an example, search amazon for the author \"Blake Cross\". (The results are Not Suitable for Work!) I have no relationship to that author or what's published!</p>\n\n<p>To see the \"ADULT\" tag exposed via Amazon's API, go to <a href=\"http://www.salesrankexpress.com/\">http://www.salesrankexpress.com/</a> and enter Blake Cross as the author name. </p>\n\n<p>The author/maintainer of Sales Rank Express explains his take on the ADULT tag in his FAQ at <a href=\"http://www.salesrankexpress.com/#adult\">http://www.salesrankexpress.com/#adult</a> - in short, he says it appears to be arbitrary and inconsistent. He concludes, \"By contrast, a surprising number of Kindle books are blatantly pornographic without being labeled 'Adult'.\"</p>\n\n<p>Our own specific medium is electronic books (we stopped doing print books), Romance genre. We've concluded pretty much the same thing as the Sales Rank Express maintainer. It seems to be based on the book cover rather than the text content, and rather arbitrary. It seems to be more subtle things such as setting and situation, facial expression, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, as publisher, there are NO clear guidelines; the publisher is NOT informed when an offering is deemed \"Adult.\"</p>\n\n<p>For something like Blake Cross's offerings, the reason for ADULT designation is obvious.

All material handles well in non-lossy formats (among others most of the TIFF formats, PNG), however such format produce large files. When you look at space saving compressed formats, photos handle well in JPEG, and images of scanned text are best represented in DjVu.</p>\n\n<p>My own experience from scanning mangas drawn on paper (so my daughter can take them on her ebook) are that for that, JPEG is a good format and that I best convert the scan to the physical dimensions of her reader. This gives optimal size of the files. And because of the interpolation that is done on the computer vs the one on the device is of better quality, it looks better and is faster in displaying.\nI noticed this when I had generated her drawings in EPUB form for my reader (with a higher resolution) and then read the same EPUB on hers. The images are combined in a simple EPUB file with the stylesheets setting borders to 0. (I do all calculations for that in pixels, not bothering with physical sizes and resolution, which in the end resolves to the same).</p>\n",

Newer versions of the program can even text. Text reflow preserves images and even mathematical formulas -- which is something that Sony's built-in text reflow cannot do.</p>\n\n<p>Download the program, set the options for your reader on a Windows/Mac/Linux machine and generate a new PDF with only one column, cropped margins and possibly larger letters. The conversion progress is largely automatic, just give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not mind jailbreaking your reader, there are also PDF viewers that include k2pdfopt and so you can change font size and other parameters on the fly. These also have the advantage that you can use the PDF's table of contents (something the official PDF viewer does not support). The readers are all forked from the same project and only differ in how you input your data. They are <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=209276\">KOReader</a> (for Kobos and Kindles with a touch screens), <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=157047\">KindlePDFViewer</a> (for Kindles with keyboard) and <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=198742\">Librerator</a> (for Kindles with neither touch nor keyboard).</p>\n\n<p>A clear disadvantage is that these programs seem to drain more battery than the official PDF viewer, but on the other hand reading is more convenient, because you can still read in portrait mode and your pages are preprocessed in the background (turning pages feels faster in large PDFs with many images). And battery life is still several weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Other than this you can of course read in landscape mode. This can be quite annoying with multicolumn documents or if you want to go back just one page to look something up (may feel slow). It is fine for texts you read without going back and it's still the way to go e.g. if you have large tables in your document. I used it for text books as well for years, so it is not too annoying.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is converting the PDF to Mobi using Calibre or Amazon's mailing service. This will usually fail completely in multicolumn documents, will remove images and destroy mathematical formulas. It will also often lead to page numbers or chapter names (if it is written on top of every page) in between the text.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Ed, the answer more depends on your purpose. The literal answer is Scrivener does indeed create valid e-books and is well maintained. I've used Scrivener for Mac for years. I've occasionally compiled the document to kindle format to carry around. That process works just fine.</p>\n\n<p>If your real purpose is to Write the Great Novel or some other large and complex effort, I can definitely recommend Scrivener as a great authoring tool. Their user forum over at Literature and Latte is helpful, knowledgeable, active. At the point of Becoming Published, you may need to switch to a different tool for the process of publishing. That would depend on your publishing route. Scrivener is very good at generating whatever format you need at that point, be it input to Microsoft Word, Calibre, various markup languages, whatever.</p>\n\n<p>If you have already created that content, so that now your focus is on the publishing stage, not the writing stage, Scrivener is adequate to the task but probably not your best choice. You're probably better off with a universal conversion tool such as Calibre.</p>\n\n<p>The key question is Where and How you intend to publish. If you're thinking of going through a traditional publisher, they have their own requirements, and that might dictate your choice of tool.</p>\n\n<p>If you're intending to self-publish, e-books only, you again want to consider the big picture. Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon, Kobo, Smash Words, etc., all have their own requirements. To meet those varying requirements, we use a combination of Microsoft Word (yuck) and Calibre. Note that this is when focused on the publishing of something already written.</p>\n\n<p>Self publishing is a moving target. What I'm suggesting here is that you consider the task of writing stuff separate from the task of getting it published. Scrivener is well designed as a writing tool. It's very good at producing output which becomes input to the publishing step. </p>\n\n<p>To directly answer your question, Can scrivener reliably create e-books? Absolutely. If you intend to personally distribute your e-books and PDF files to your friends or colleagues, Scrivener makes that task extremely easy.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you are thinking about self publishing via Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc., or via a traditional publisher (who might in turn publish to Amazon, etc.), use Scrivener for writing, and whatever the process demands for the publishing part.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>As I re-read your question, I realized I missed a point. You ask about technical, formatting, and other hurdles. If you are self publishing via various outlets (Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon, etc.), each has different formatting requirements. \"Doing the rounds\" is a matter of continuously reformatting the completed work, fixing rejections and resubmitting, and so on. I can assure you that you will have countless technical, formatting, and other hurdles as you travel that route, but that fact has nothing to do with Scrivener.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Scrivener for Mac is straightforward and easy to use. It's designed for authors creating their works, and that's where it shines.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a concrete example. One destination will require a table of contents linked a certain way, whereas another might allow it to be at the back of the document. Scrivener is not your best tool for this constant reformatting of content to meet publisher requirements. Scrivener is an excellent tool for creating the content in the first place.</p>\n",

There are few apps installed, sometimes none. There's little temptation to use the device for other purposes - they're for reading, period.</p>\n\n<p>I've provided over 20 kindles to 10 schools in rural Kenya so far, they can be charged using a small (3 watt) low-power solar panel (via a battery to store the solar charge as the kindle keyboard power circuitry doesn't cope well with the raw, variable power from the panel), and they last up to a month on a charge. Newer tablet or smartphone based devices need significantly more power, more often. They also consume lots more network traffic e.g. to update the apps, the operating system, to send and receive emails, messages, etc. Kindles in particular are parsimonious with the network bandwidth and therefore inexpensive to support (3G devices are essentially free); again Tablets and Smartphones use much more bandwidth and can easily use all the paid-for data allowance of a 3G mobile connection. </p>\n\n<p>So I'm not sure whether you'd consider low power and network consumption 'features' for you - for me they are key features and advantages.

Amazon's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200767340\">Personal Documents Service</a> can help you with transfer and conversion, and <a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\">Calibre</a> is an extremely popular tool for ebook-management which provides such conversions easily. PDF files which are mostly text are also quite easy to convert to a supported ebook format.</p>\n\n<p>The one big wrinkle in the all-around compatibility I'm describing here is that books protected by DRM (a Digital Rights Management scheme), the DRM prevents it from being converted into different formats. So an ebook you buy at barnesandnoble.com, which is formatted and protected exclusively for the B&amp;N Nook e-reader, cannot be easily converted for the Kindle. </p>\n\n<p>Many major ebook retailers rely on DRM to help \"lock you in\" to their specific device, platform, and store. So basically, ebooks you get at non-Amazon stores are unlikely to be compatible with the Kindle (unless they specifically note that the ebook has no DRM), whereas ebooks from other sources (e.g. the out-of-copyright classics at Project Gutenberg, or ebooks you create yourself using a service like Instapaper) should present no difficulty.</p>\n",

For example, people used to write \"non-zero\" and \"soft-ware\" instead of \"nonzero\" and \"software\"; the same trend has occurred for hundreds of other words. Thus it's high time for everybody to stop using the archaic spelling \"e-mail'\". Think of how many keystrokes you will save in your lifetime if you stop now! The form \"email\" has been well established in England for several years, so I am amazed to see Americans being overly conservative in this regard.

The only real question is if \"ebook\" will stick or if we will end up on just \"book\".  It's instructive to note that if someone tells me to mail them a document, I will reach for my computer and not for a paper envelope.</p>\n",

If it's a static text, and the publisher was only trying to follow the latest guidelines and standards, they may have added the extra bits required by the older standard, so it would degrade gracefully and be available to more customers.</p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, the book was released as an EPUB 3 in order to take full advantage of the standard's dynamics and interactivity, it's likely that the publisher didn't add the required legacy information.  They might have pegged a particular device, to ensure that the book would function predictably.  For example, Walrus Books released H.P. Lovecraft's novel, \"Kadath\", for the iBooks app in EPUB 3.  It is highly interactive and intended for the iPad. They had no reason to make it work on other devices, and probably didn't bother with legacy shims.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your question about software, I'm not aware of a good GUI for creating EPUB 3s. I use Dreamweaver to modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly, and ePubPack and 7zip to pack and unpack it.  Then I test it with ePubCheck. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>In my opinion the relative inaccessibility of DjVu's <code>libdjvu</code>, including having their own bytestream compression contributed to the low acceptance of the DjVu format over the years and not patent issues. This hinders other software developers adapting their software to support DjVu and even more so \nwhen porting to a new platform.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The DjVuLibre software has several characteristics that make it difficult to port. It is C++ based code that builds on a framework that seems to be generically usable, but is probably DjVuLibre specific. I conclude that on not having encountered the framework anywhere else, as well as specific names of classes, etc. that include the substring <code>DJVU</code>) in the framework. That framework, in the form of <code>libdjvu</code>, is however used in all of the DjVuLibre tools (<code>bzz</code>. <code>djvu...</code>)</p>\n\n<p>The <code>libdjvu</code> being a C++ library  makes it less portable and less accessible for being called from other languages (e.g. Python), than a C based library.</p>\n\n<p>To complicate things, the bytestreams in the DjVu file format are compressed using a Burrows Wheeler encoder. The encoder is similar to <code>bzip2</code> but has its own, DjVu specific, implementation. This gives a small advantage over more standard compression schemes, but this is dwarfed by the conceptual better handling of compression of the images through the use of wavelet encoding and individually compressed layers.</p>\n\n<p>I analysed the DjVuLibre software some time ago, to extract OCR-ed text. I settled for a minimal Python implementation for that piece, as I could not get a Python program to hook up to the C++ libraries in a reasonable amount of time. I spent a few days getting the Python implementation to work, analysing the intransparent program flow of the library, all the while comparing the output with results from <code>djvutxt</code> and <code>bzz</code>. This resulted in the DJVU OCR extraction program included in Calibre. (The difficulties might be based on\nmy lack of programming experience: I have been programming C++ since the late 80's&mdash;one of the first commercial things I developed in C++  was a library  for creating GIF files in 1987&mdash;and have used Python since the mid 90's).</p>\n\n<p>I must say I really like the DjVu concepts, and love the superior quality/filesize ratio, compared to scans in other file formats I have used. I <strong>always</strong> scan to .DjVu. But although I primarily work on a Linux system, the scanning/conversion process includes commercial software running on a Windows box that gives me even better compression results than the open DjVuLibre library does (as well as OCR without an additional program).</p>\n",

I did not create or convert the formats personally and I am unsure of the exact versions (e.g. epub2 vs epub3). I still thought this might be useful information since all books were generated by the same company (<a href=\"http://manning.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">manning</a>). These are all programming books, and as such, they have some images in them and embedded markup language. This should provide a decent comparison vs. something that is only text or mostly images.</p>\n\n<p>The following list of books are compared in epub, mobi and pdf (sizes are in KiloBytes, <strong>smallest bolded</strong>).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/baley/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brownfield Application Development in .NET</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>epub - 3,447K</strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 4,115K</li>\n<li>pdf - 8,573K</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/skeet2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">C# in Depth, Second Edition</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>epub - 5,429K</strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 6,330K</li>\n<li>pdf - 8,573K</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/jackson/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTML5 for .NET Developers</a> <strong><em>(results skewed by this book, see below)</em></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>epub - 24,533K</li>\n<li>mobi - 13,945K</li>\n<li><strong>pdf - 13,177K</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/siddaway2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PowerShell and WMI</a>\n<ul>\n<li>epub - <strong>8,797K</strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 11,081K</li>\n<li>pdf - 14,536K</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/petricek/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Real-World Functional Programming With examples in F# and C#</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>epub - 8,483K</strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 9,446K</li>\n<li>pdf - 14,536K</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/osherove/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Art of Unit Testing with Examples in .Net</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>epub - 4,280K</strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 4,754K</li>\n<li>pdf - 9,535K</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/osherove2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Art of Unit Testing with examples in .Net, Second Edition</a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>epub - 3,784K</strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 4,356K</li>\n<li>pdf - 9,535K</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Average Sizes</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>epub - 8,396K</li>\n<li><em><strong>mobi - 7,717K</em></strong></li>\n<li>pdf - 11,426K</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In almost all cases, the epub was the smallest file. Mobi was slightly larger and pdf was the largest. However, the average size of the mobi files were actually smaller overall. This was due to one very large epub file for the <code>HTML5 for .Net Developers</code> book. This book skewed the results since the file was nearly twice the size of the other formats. My best guess is because this file contains many HTML code examples, which may cause problems for the epub format (basically XHTML). Perhaps this is an epub3 format, which supports HTML5 (the book title is a good hint). Again, I did not generate these files, so I am not certain of the reason.</p>\n\n<p>To combat this single anomaly, I decided to remove that book from the averages. When removing the book, the averages of the remaining books looks like so:</p>\n\n<p><em>Average Sizes (removing HTML5 for .Net Developers - i.e. the anomaly)</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>epub - 5,703K</em></strong></li>\n<li>mobi - 6,678K</li>\n<li>pdf - 11,134K</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take it for what it is worth, but in these findings it suggests that the epub and mobi formats are quite close in size, while the pdf format is nearly double.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer to be continued with newer formats and more research.</strong></p>\n",

    "body": "<p>The intent of your question seems to be, \"Which e-books formats are safe to buy (or obtain legally for free) - such that they will never go obsolete on any future device I use?\"</p>\n\n<p>There are actually several approaches to this issue, but you first need to understand a little about DRM (Digital Rights Management):</p>\n\n<p>DRM attempts to prevent illegal copying of books you purchase. DRM creates the following problem for honest consumers: Let's say you buy books protected by DRM from one marketplace. How can you read a book you purchased if you switch to a competitor's device that uses a different DRM scheme for the same or different format?</p>\n\n<p>With that question in mind, here are several approaches you can take to preserving books you obtain for the long haul:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You could elect to stick with the two most popular,\nnon-proprietary formats - epubs and PDFs - and never buy books that\nhave DRM. Store these books in a sharing service such as Dropbox and\nyou'll be able to easily open them on pretty much any desktop or\nmobile device. Even devices that don't have Dropbox will usually\nallow side loading of content when you hook them up to your PC.</li>\n<li>You can mostly do (1) above, but also purchase books that make\nthemselves available in the top 3 formats upon purchase (epub, PDF,\nand one of Amazon's 2 formats). Many programming textbooks and\nreference materials can be purchased this way. All purchases I've\nmade this way did not have DRM but even if they did have DRM, I\nwould be covered.</li>\n<li>You could choose an ecosystem that supports a wide variety of\nhardware and stick with it. For example, Amazon goes to great\nlengths to insure that books you buy from their Kindle store will be\nreadable on any Android or iOS device, as well as on a Mac or\nWindows desktop computer. You are not locked in to always buying\nKindle devices. This is not perfect, however, as you won't be able\nto read the Kindle on hardware that purposely keeps out Amazon\nsoftware, such as the Nook (SimpleTouch, Glowlight). However, if you\npurposely stick to relatively open software platforms (Android, iOS,\nMac OS X, MS Windows) you won't have an issue.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I personally do a combination of all three. When possible to obtain books for free (legally), I do so, and store it in my dropbox \"ebooks\" folder. When possible to buy books in multiple formats, I do so. But in instances when I can't do either of these (or book price is so low I don't really care), I purchase from Amazon's book store.</p>\n",

We recommend that you check with\n  your mobile provider to make sure you have a data plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if your Kindle supports web browsing (and has an HTML5 compatible browser), then yes you can. Otherwise, you are forced to use one of their native apps for the devices mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Or another option as mentioned by DVK in the comments, you can turn your Kindle into a generic Android device. It's possible to do this because Kindle devices (and Nook for that matter) are using Android under the hood. Amazon (or Barnes and Knoble for the Nook) just design the stuff on top of Google's open-source operating system. Once you convert your device to a generic Android device, you can run the native Android app provided by audiobooks.com. As for how to change your device, if you choose that route, there are many tutorials out there. <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/turning-kindle-nook-real-android-tablet-232600898.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is one to get you started.</p>\n",

Most licencing restricts distribution to those people who have a specific distribution licence and pay the appropriate royalties and fees to the publisher and author.</p>\n\n<p>There is some question about older books that are public domain.  The content of the book(the text) is the only thing that is public domain.  The Ebook has added markup and is covered under copyright laws as a new creation.  You can still use the public domain content as permitted, but the markup and any images included that are not public domain images are covered. </p>\n\n<p>Also just because you are in a country that may not enforce copyright and licencing from the country of origin, does not mean that the copyright does not exist.

One for E-Ink screens and one for LCD screens. </p>\n\n<p>The Coles notes version for E-Ink screens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use a dry cloth or dampen a cloth with water (microfiber preferred).</li>\n<li>Do not apply water directly.</li>\n<li>Carefully wipe screen with cloth and allow to dry before using.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Coles notes version for LCD screens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Microfiber cloth</li>\n<li>LCD solution or mix (50-50) isopropyl alcohol and distilled water (not tap water!)</li>\n<li>Moisten cloth, wipe and dry before use.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So one recommends water and one recommends against water. PRS-650 is a touch screen, but is E-Ink display. So which way is better?

Then apply similar changes to the equivalent file in the other language. </p>\n\n<p>Note: you don't need to actually publish with leanpub, but you can. And you retain copyright of what you write (unless you choose to assign copyright, etc).</p>\n",

Since ebook polishing (using calibre) is done quicker than the time a message is displayed, this queue overflows and calibre cannot write messages to it any more, and (on last try at least) calibre did lock up.</p>\n\n<p>If you look in any directory where calibre stores the EPUB, you can see that there is a <code>metadata.opf</code> file that contains the metadata for the corresponding ebook. You have to specify this file as argument for the <code>ebook-polish</code> program together (<code>-o</code> option), together with the corresponding EPUB file.</p>\n\n<p>What you therefore need to do is make list of 'outdated' EPUB files (outdated compared to the <code>metadata.opf</code> files in the same directory), and then call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ebook-polish -o path/to/metadata.opf path/to/book.epub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and rename the output (<code>path/to/book_polished.epub</code>) to <code>path/to/book.epub</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://anthon.home.xs4all.nl/rants/2013/_static/ebook_parallel_polish\">script</a> referred to in the above rant does exactly that. As prerequisite you need to have <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/\">GNU parallel</a> installed¹.</p>\n\n<p>With the script I was able to process 1329 polishes in 3m25. Searching and updating 4 changed files in 2400+ item database with 1600+ books now takes less than 2 seconds². Of course files in the calibre database that are not supported by ebook-publish (such as PDF) are completely skipped.</p>\n\n<p>¹ <sub>In case you wonder, yes the script, via <code>parallel</code>, calls itself for each file to call<code>ebook-polish</code> and rename the output</sub><br>\n² <sub>Fast enought to always try and polish the EPUB files before I synchronise the selected files with the reader devices</sub><br></p>\n",

In that regard, people who \"would have paid you\" probably will pay you for that premium of having the latest/greatest errata-free versions (at least for tech books.)</p>\n\n<p>A closing thought: I suspect that there is a strong correlation between how pirated your content is and how many copies that you actually sell.

That is the text is printed at certain xy coordinates on the paper (gross simplification). When PDF was designed they never envisioned screen size to shrink to that of an iPhone. Hence the need to zoom/pan when reading PDFs. You just can't wrap the lines at a screen boundary. Tools exist but do a miserable job at it. In fact, generating a PDF is quite algorithmic in nature. Regenerating the original word file (say) requires complex AI algorithms and the like and is not 100% correct, unless the conversion itself was of a simple document with headers/text only.</p>\n\n<p>So, this makes it all the more difficult on e-ink screens since they don't really have a screen refresh rate (e.g. 60Hz) like LCD screens. The PDF in essence shows up as the size of the screen on which it's displayed. If the screen is small, you have to pan/zoom. E-inks are horrible for that since they don't redraw the screen continuously. It'll be very jerky and quite irritiating. Single column PDFs with lots of text read fine, but you may have to change orientation of the device to see what fits best.</p>\n\n<p>My previous Kindle was stolen. When deciding for the 'next' reader/tablet to buy my biggest concern along with cost/weight/resolution was ease of reading PDFs especially in portrait mode. Since I have a lot of papers/texts to read every now and then I needed something with a great PDF reading experience. This implies things with 16:9 aspect ratio is out since the screens are quite narrow. 16:10 (e.g. Nook HD+) or 4:3 (iPad) are really good at portrait rendering of PDFs.</p>\n\n<p>I went with Nook HD+ ($149) in the end and have been very happy with it. Bottom line: E-ink screens are great for sequential reading of content (e.g. novels etc.,) and single column PDFs having a decent font size/style. However, for a good PDF reading experience you should opt for an LCD tablet IMHO. It's not the fault of the e-ink reader that it can't render PDFs with ease, it's the fault of the design assumptions of the PDF format itself. Adobe is working on a new format to allow for this 'reflowability' but I don't know when it'll be out (it was code-named \"Mars\").</p>\n",

There is a plethora of programs out there that allow you to make slides in many forms and there are <a href=\"http://www.duarte.com/book/slideology/\">books</a> on the subject as well¹.</p>\n\n<p>From personal experience I can recommend starting with a structured mark-up based format for editing that is then converted to PDF and your preferred ebook format (e.g. EPUB). Using mark-up instead of visual positioning will make it easier to keep the slides consistent. <a href=\"http://sphinx-doc.org/\">Sphinx</a>, based on the <a href=\"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html\">reStructured Text</a> markup, can generate both PDF and EPUB and an <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-slide/\">extension</a> allows you to embed your slides on <code>slideshare.net</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If your slides are going to contain mathematics formula, you might want to look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX\">LaTeX</a> and the slide generation package (<a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations#The_Beamer_package\">beamer</a>) for that instead.</p>\n\n<p>¹ <sub>Edward Tufte has written a great <a href=\"http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint\">essay</a> on the problems with PowerPoint presentations, a must read for anyone making slides.</sub></p>\n",

    "body": "<p>The answer to that can largely be broken down into two parts for EPUB2 and EPUB3.  First, for EPUB2 as it is currently the most common EPUB format: The most important thing to understand with regards to EPUB compatibility is that there are actually only a few readers available for commercial (i.e. DRM'd) EPUB content. As you might expect, Amazon and Apple made their own readers, but the vast majority of other commercially DRM'd readers are based off of Adobe's RMSDK, and as such they are mostly subject to similar limitations and quirks.  Now since there are literally hundreds of known and fixed issues with RMSDK, there is no possible way that I can list them all, but I can point you at the best publically available resource I know of, <a href=\"http://kb.datalogics.com/articles/FAQ/What-updates-fixes-changes-and-enhancements-have-been-made-to-the-Adobe-Reader-Mobile-SDK-by-Datalogics?retURL=/apex/knowledgeProduct?c=Adobe_Reader_Mobile_SDK&amp;k=&amp;lang=en_US&amp;popup=false&amp;lang=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">Datalogic's Release Notes</a>.  These are issues that Datalogics finds and fixes itself with regards to RMSDK rendering bugs, and these issues are often then fixed by Adobe in future versions of RMSDK, so at any given time you have to be on the lookout for any of these issues with regards to whatever RMSDK renderer you are looking at (including for example any of the <a href=\"http://www.bluefirereader.com/white-label-apps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluefire Reader Branded Readers</a>.) The last I knew, Kindle was still using RMSDK to render EPUBs, so this would apply to Kindle as well unless something has changed recently.</p>\n\n<p>The second biggest place that I know of for rendering EPUBs is Apple's iBooks, and a quick google search will turn up copious numbers of frustrated authors trying to get their books rendering correctly, but unfortunately I don't have any kind of \"current issues\" source for them.  (If anyone else does, I would <em>love</em> to see it).  They do regularly improve their rendering engine as well, but their release notes tend to mention solely the user interface changes.  </p>\n\n<p>Then of course, the there is the issue of the EPUB3 Spec. This might be where I have the best news of all, which is that there is an on-going, regularly updated support grid put out by BISG that tracks which renderers support which features.  That extremely helpful document can be found <a href=\"http://epubtest.org/results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n",

Both textbooks have graphical elements which break the flow of the text.\n The Sherlock has Two columns about forty characters wide. The paperbacks varied from 50 characters wide to 70 (that one had almost no margin.)

Possibly those of us with the sharpest eyes might distinguish 800 dots in an inch.

Well, first there was the margin of error; and second the text being set might need to be enlarged — for instance a headline might need to be larger to fit a particular width — and enlarging any specific resolution lowers the dpi.</p>\n\n<p>(High-end typesetting equipment ran as high as 3000 or 3500 dpi; this enabled gradients or blends to be smoother.</p>\n\n<p>You can't really compare a reflective medium like ink on paper with display media, but display resolution higher than 200 pixels per inch or so is indistinguishable under most conditions. As with print, color gradients or blends will appear smoother with even higher resolutions.</p>\n\n<p>As LCD resolution goes higher than 200 ppi, you probably won't notice any difference in display or normal-sized text. However, text below 6 pts in size does seem sharper. </p>\n\n<p>I haven't done any studies on type color at display resolutions between 200 and 350 ppi, but the higher available resolutions may well benefit bold and italic words within normal text.</p>\n\n<p>So, to summarize: basically 200 ppi display resolution is equivalent to print on better-than-newsprint-quality paper, but variant weights and styles within a single font at the same size may benefit from \"retina\" displays above 300 ppi.</p>\n",

ONe topic her blog entry focuses on is how Lindsay Buroker used <code>the power of perma-free</code> and how it can increase awareness of your books to increase sales.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What ended up working for Lindsay was making one of her books\n  permanently free and distributing it as widely as possible. People\n  loved her work, went looking for more, and when they found her other\n  books they were happy to pay for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Karen, Lindsay herself said (Lindsay's original blog entry <a href=\"http://www.lindsayburoker.com/tips-and-tricks/how-do-you-improve-international-ebook-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What did make a difference for me, especially with Amazon UK and the\n  international Apple stores, was having a book permanently free on\n  those sites. I’ve talked a lot about this before, but I made my first\n  Emperor’s Edge book (and eventually my first Flash Gold novella as\n  well) free at Smashwords about a year ago. I had the freebies\n  distributed through their partner sites, and Amazon eventually matched\n  the price.</p>\n  \n  <p>What took longer, but did eventually happen, is that Amazon UK (and\n  DE, ES, IT, etc.) price-matched the ebook to free as well. That’s when\n  I started seeing sales of my other books in those stores. It was a\n  similar process for iTunes. It’s taken a while for the free ebooks to\n  percolate through, showing up in the international Apple stores, but\n  I’m now selling books every month in Apple AUD, DKK, GBR, etc. and am\n  making between $1,500 and $2,000/mo overall in overseas sales.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After this blog entry, she posted a <a href=\"http://blog.karenwoodward.org/2012/11/using-permanently-free-books-to.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">follow-up blog entry</a>. It covers the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make The Ebook Version Free, Charge For The Paper Copy (examples with Seth Godin and David Gaughran)</li>\n<li>Eric Flint and the Baen Free Library</li>\n<li>Independent Author Robert J. Crane: Perma-Free Works</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Quick Summary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this post I want to look, first, at a variation on the idea of\n  using permanently free electronic books to increase sales of your\n  other work: make the ebook version of a book free and use it as\n  advertising for the paper version. Then we'll look at another indie\n  author--Robert J. Crane--who uses the technique of perma-free to sell\n  books AND he has been so kind as to share his sales figures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is the blurb about Robert J. Crane and using perma-free works to push sales:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indie author Robert J. Crane left a comment on my first post where he\n  generously shared some of his sales figures. I have Robert's kind his\n  permission to reproduce his comment here:</p>\n  \n  <p>I have two books set to perma-free, the results are thus:</p>\n  \n  <p>Released my first book [Defender] in June 2011. Between then and June\n  2012 I never sold more than low double digits (best month was\n  something like 25 sales across 3 novels and 2 short stories). </p>\n  \n  <p>Set my first series book free in my high fantasy series in July 2012,\n  my urban fantasy series first book [Alone] permafree in September\n  2012.</p>\n  \n  <p>July 2012: 169 sales Aug 2012: 319 sales Sep 2012: 1759 sales Oct\n  2012: 2727 sales Nov 1st to 20th: 3008 sales</p>\n  \n  <p>Most of these are at $4.99 or their foreign equivalent. Hope this\n  helps give a little inspiration or data to make a decision off of, at\n  least. </p>\n  \n  <p>Needless to say, I highly recommend perma-free.  Wow! Look at that\n  jump between August and September in terms of sales: 1,590 units more.\n  That's over 5 times better than any of the previous months. And at 70%\n  of $4.99 that's over $5,000.*</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So evidence (though it may not be hard facts) does suggest that using free books/ebooks can increase revenue.</p>\n\n<p><em>NOTE: I have sent Karen a message to ensure she is ok with excerpts from her blog post to be copied here.</em></p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I've worked quite a bit with solar chargers for Kindles. The main Kindle models I've powered are Kindle 4/5's and Kindle Keyboards (3rd edition). Let me try to answer your specific questions first, then I'll go into more background in case it's useful to you and others:</p>\n\n<p>e-ink Kindles need somewhere between 500mA and 700mA to charge effectively @ 5v DC. They have a battery of roughly 2000mAh depending on the model, so charging can take several hours. Most integrated solar chargers include some or all of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a solar panel :) These range from milli-watts fitted to the battery case, to several watts where the battery is often separate from the panel (but may be stored at the back of the panel).</p></li>\n<li><p>voltage regulators and convertors between the panel and the battery and the battery and the device it's charging</p></li>\n<li>a Li-Ion battery, similar to those fitted to mobile phones. Some with larger capacities include several batteries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are various options available, depending on your budget and what you need.</p>\n\n<p>Solarmio provide integrated covers with an inbuilt solar panel on the front and light inside the cover. These are available for the Touch and the Kindle 4 <a href=\"http://www.solarmio.com/en/4712389290168.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.solarmio.com/en/4712389290168.aspx</a> (for the Kindle 4 model). I have 2 of these currently and they seem to work very well with no complaints from the end-users (schools in Kenya). Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.worldreader.org</a> have used lots of these cases and they are reliable in use.</p>\n\n<p>I also use 3 watt panels which I connect to a generic USB battery-backed recharger. The battery stores the charge from the solar panel. From my testing of using 3 watt panels to charge Kindles directly (without an intermediate battery) caused the Kindles to hang and need rebooting, the charging didn't deliver consistent voltage (5v DC needed by the Kindle). For more info here's a blog post I wrote about some of the challenges <a href=\"http://kusaidiamwalimu.org/musings-on-solar-power-and-usb-batteries/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kusaidiamwalimu.org/musings-on-solar-power-and-usb-batteries/</a></p>\n\n<p>Picking suitable panels and batteries can be a challenge to find ones that are reliable yet cost-effective:\n- Many integrated small battery-based units with small built-in solar panels don't generate enough charge to be usable (I've tested them in various countries including Kenya near the equator in peak sunshine).\n- Similarly, most of the models I've bought have failed with the Lithium-Ion batteries swelling sufficiently to explode the case. These tend to be delivered from China or Hong-Kong, via eBay. I deliberately bought various no-name units to test their viability for my e-reader projects where I provide Kindles to schools in Kenya, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The 2 models of batteries I've found useful include a 5000mAh unit, I pay around £10 per unit on eBay.co.uk, and small 1800mAh batteries from Volt <a href=\"http://getvolt.dk/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://getvolt.dk/en/</a> (they don't currently sell them to end users, I happened to meet one of the founders and eventually obtained several to support my e-reader projects in Kenya). Here's a recent blog post about using the Volt batteries in Kenya <a href=\"http://kusaidiamwalimu.org/solar-powered-kindles-with-e-volt-batteries-at-nyabondo-school-oyugis-kenya/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kusaidiamwalimu.org/solar-powered-kindles-with-e-volt-batteries-at-nyabondo-school-oyugis-kenya/</a> </p>\n\n<p>I'd love to learn more about how other people fare with solar charging of their e-ink devices. FYI: I'm also going to be creating larger solar charging systems to charge tablet-based ereaders and devices e.g. such as Nexus 7 and iPads.</p>\n",

E.g. EPUB3 forces use of CSS for things like font size (as <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> is not supported in HTML5). However an EPUB2 device might render <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> faster than something specified in a separate CSS file, especially if applied only once in the HTML file.</sub></p>\n\n<p>² <sub>The resulting difference of any particular trade-off might be minuscule compared to other things that influence loading speed.

    "body": "<p>For me, Soft DRM is a viable option that helps the book provider to identify who they provided the book for/to. I'm not aware of any formal analysis, or reports, of how Soft DRM fares in terms of things like unauthorized copying. I've found 'soft copies' of books online that were watermarked for someone else so unauthorized copies/distribution exists. However cracked (most likely unathorized) copies of 'hard' DRM books are also available on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of my own purchasing practices, in 2013 I personally bought at least 50 ebooks online. These were mainly technical books. I bought the vast majority from 3 publishers: O'Reilly, Pragmatic Programmers, and Packt Publishing. They are all DRM Free. \n<a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.packtpub.com/about</a>\n<a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/category/ebooks.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://shop.oreilly.com/category/ebooks.do</a>\n<a href=\"http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks</a> (they say most, not all books are DRM free. The ones I've bought from them, at least 10 titles, all are).</p>\n\n<p>I have bought various books that have soft DRM e.g. from Apress <a href=\"http://www.apress.com/customer-support/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.apress.com/customer-support/</a> and Commonsware <a href=\"https://wares.commonsware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wares.commonsware.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>And I've bought very few books with active DRM, with one exception - ebooks bought for Kindles. I explain some of my reasons later on in this reply.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my original answer, which includes some of my opinions (as requested by the question)</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to buy ebooks with watermarks such as 'prepared for Julian Harty' as I'm able to easily copy the file onto the various computers and devices I use from time to time over the years. (I have ebooks first obtained over a decade ago, my computers from those days tend to have died.)</p>\n\n<p>Having a watermark is a low-barrier for people determined to share / copy material regardless of copyright, however for me it's part of an honour-based system where I've legitimately obtained material where I shouldn't share it. </p>\n\n<p>I tend not to buy hard-DRM'd ebooks; the one exception being books from Amazon's Kindle store. The Kindle ecosystem is compelling and one I've gotten used to. One key benefit is global 3G access to content at no extra charge from my 3G Kindles. I'm willing to tolerate DRM on the Kindles, and haven't had problems reading my Kindle content on lots of devices over the years I've been using them.</p>\n\n<p>So for any publishers who read this answer, please realize you're less likely for me to buy from you. I've <em>not bought</em> tens of technical books when I discovered the site uses DRM. Instead I'll find similar books from stores that don't use hard DRM. I want to be able to easily migrate stuff I buy from device to device over the years.</p>\n",

Removing metadata is not enough, since the watermarking could be added via steganographic approach. Some formats such as PDF, have a plethora of possibilities to hide information.

I\n  asked them to list their most successful book in 2012 and how many\n  copies it sold. At the outset, I want to say that this survey was\n  informal. There is nothing scientific about it, but it does provide an\n  interesting snapshot of how self-published authors are really doing.</p>\n  \n  <p>To give context to the numbers, I wanted to also provide a guide to\n  what the most popular price points translate to in actual dollars.\n  Using Amazon's conversion chart, here it is:</p>\n  \n  <p>0.99 (35 percent royalty): $0.35 per sale<br>\n  1.99 (35 percent royalty): $0.70 per sale<br>\n  2.99 (70 percent royalty): $2.04 per sale<br>\n  3.99 (70 percent royalty): $2.74 per sale<br>\n  4.99 (70 percent royalty): $3.44 per sale<br></p>\n  \n  <p>While I didn't ask authors to list their most common price point\n  (which I will add to the survey next time), I thought the breakdown\n  above would be enlightening to the authors out there who might be\n  waffling about whether they ought to try their hand at\n  self-publishing. If you are thinking about whether or not you should\n  dip your toe into the revolutionary waters, ask yourself these\n  questions: When was the last time I made $3.44 on the sale of one\n  book? When was the last time I made even $2.04 on the sale of one\n  book?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She then goes on to post a bunch of survey results broken down by author. Here is a sample of one of the survey results:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Elisabeth Naughton<br> Romantic Suspense and Paranormal <br>Total number of\n  self-published titles: 12 <br>Total number of self-published sales in\n  2010: 0 <br>Total number of self-published sales in 2011: 0 <br>Total number\n  of self-published sales in 2012: 102,179 <br>Total number of\n  self-published sales so far in 2013: Jan-March 2013: 370,059 <br>Most\n  successful book in 2012 and how many sold: MARKED - 30,673 copies</p>\n  \n  <p>I've been traditionally published for four years and my income comes\n  primarily from my self-published titles, NOT my traditionally\n  published titles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

DRM\n  prevents the unauthorized copying or redistribution of eBooks, to\n  protect the rights of authors and publishers. There are different\n  types of DRM, but Kobo supports a version by Adobe.

(A file\n  format is how books are stored on your computer.) If you downloaded a\n  book and received an ACSM file, don't worry – this isn't a problem.\n  The ACSM file is the license for the PDF or EPUB book you bought. To\n  get the book itself you just need to open the ACSM file in Adobe\n  Digital Editions. Digital Editions will verify your license and then\n  download your eBook in either EPUB or PDF format. You can then\n  transfer your book to your Kobo eReader (or another compatible\n  eReader).</p>\n  \n  <p>You will get a license file if you download a book that is protected\n  by Adobe Digital Rights Management (DRM).

Such reference mechanisms include, as a partial list,\n  hypertext links within OPS Content Documents, and references by the\n  NCX, Tours and Guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For each itemref, the publication author may specify the optional\n  linear attribute to designate whether the associated OPS Content\n  Document is primary (linear=\"yes\", which is the default when linear is\n  not present) or auxiliary (linear=\"no\".) It is important that the\n  publication author include some kind of internal reference, such as a\n  hypertext link, to any OPS Content Document that is declared to be\n  auxiliary; it is recommended that references be added to NCX for all\n  auxiliary content. At least one itemref in spine must be declared\n  primary. </p>\n  \n  <p>Specifying whether an OPS Content Document is primary or\n  auxiliary is useful for Reading Systems which opt to present auxiliary\n  content differently than primary content. For example, a Reading\n  System might opt to render auxiliary content in a popup window apart\n  from the main window which presents the primary content. (For an\n  example of the types of content that may be considered auxiliary,\n  refer to the example below and the subsequent discussion.) </p>\n  \n  <p>Reading Systems are not required to differentiate between primary and\n  auxiliary content, and for the requirements and recommendations given\n  in this section may consider all OPS Content Documents in spine to be\n  primary, regardless of the value of the linear attribute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means, all items which are referenced, as footnotes in your case, must be included\nin the spine. They can be declared as auxilary, with <code>linear=no</code>, but it is up to reading\nsystem, how it deals with that.</p>\n\n<p>More advanced readers, like <code>Azardi</code> or <code>Readium</code>, works correctly and display auxilary items only on request (link click). Others, like <code>ADE</code>, or <code>Calibre</code> in your case, work in the other way. </p>\n\n<p>As I think you use <code>tex4ht</code> for conversion from <code>LaTeX</code> to <code>html</code>, you may try to generate inline footnotes, which doesn't make new file for each footnote, but are collected at the end the <code>html</code> file with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>htlatex filename \"xhtml, fn-in\"\n</code></pre>\n",

    "body": "<p>Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing allows you to create an author account where you publish and manage your e-books through Amazon. You have to provide your real name and social security number as well as bank account information so that they can pay you and also so they can report your earnings. However, you do not have to use your real name on any of the titles that you publish through them. They allow you to provide any name you want for the author, and you are not required to provide a publisher's name. If you want, you can tie your author account to your titles, but it is not required. I currently have over thirty titles published with them using my own name and three different pseudonyms. </p>\n\n<p>I have only recently started using B&amp;N's Nook Press, but it appears that they provide the same capability. I currently have twelve titles published through them using two different pseudonyms. My account is registered in my real name, but the books I have published through them do not have my real name tied to them.</p>\n\n<p>Smashwords, on the other hand, is not nearly as friendly. If you want to keep your identity separated with them, you will need to create a separate account for each one of your pseudonyms. I currently have only my real name and one pseudonym distributed through them. I am looking at other options that I may use in the future to replace them.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in one of the other answers, there is no hard and fast guarantee that you will be able to remain 100% anonymous, but it is possible to publish under a different name and still get paid using your real name and current bank accounts.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Amazon does still do the price matching, and that is the only way to get your book listed as free on their site. The advantage of Smashwords is in distributing to Apple and Sony. If you go to your e-book's details page on Amazon, you will see a link that says \"tell us about a lower price\". You can click that link and provide them a link to the product page for your free book at one of the other sites, and eventually they will match it. Again, this seems to be more effective with Apple and Sony. The process may take a week or two, so if you can get others to click that link and share the news, it will help speed things up.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to make your book free for a limited time or on a specific date, I would definitely NOT recommend this approach. There is no way to control how quickly or when Amazon will respond, so you won't be able to determine the specific date(s). Also, if you think you may want to raise the price back up after a while, I would not recommend doing this. I have one title that I published under a pseudonym that has been free for months, in spite of the fact that I have raised the price on all other sites and tried repeatedly to get Amazon to raise the price. </p>\n",

The Skybook eReader program doesn't even have print functionality, or else I would simply print as a PDF.</p>\n\n<p>If it helps, I have a computer running Windows XP.</p>\n\n<p><sub>Note: I was able to get another version of the ebook in <code>.djvu</code> format, so I don't really have to worry about <code>.sbrz</code> format anymore, but let me leave the question up so that other people who run into this file extension can get help.</sub></p>\n",

    "body": "<p>In general, formatting with HTML (though regarded as outdated by many, including W3C) tends to work more reliably than formatting with CSS. Support to CSS varies and can be disabled (though this is rare and mainly applies to web browsers). However, HTML formatting is very limited. You can use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for italic, <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> for superscript, and a little else, but you cannot e.g. specify the size or vertical position of superscripts (which depend on user agent and vary considerably).</p>\n\n<p>In e-books, however, we can expect CSS work well for the simple formatting that would be possible in CSS, too. I tested your example, with an ebook created with Sigil and then converted to .mobi format with Calibre, and viewed with Kindle for PC, the exponents worked OK, the same way with HTML only, when I used the obvious CSS rules</p>\n\n<pre><code>.corsivo { font-style: italic }\n.apicecorsivo { font-style: italic; vertical-align: super; font-size: 80% }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So if the exponents didn’t work, probably either the e-book is missing a CSS rule that makes <code>.apicecorsivo</code> appear as a superscript, or that rule was somehow lost when generating the .mobi version.</p>\n\n<p>For stylistic reasons, it is best to avoid mixing HTML and CSS formatting so that e.g. some exponents are marked with <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>, some just styled with CSS (set on <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements for example). The reason is that generally you cannot guarantee that the style applied is really the same. Your example has <code>&lt;span class=\"apicecorsivo\"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;</code>, which is meant to produce “n−1” as superscript, but it may happen that they will be <em>differently</em> subscripted, i.e. in different font size or in different vertical position.</p>\n\n<p>There are considerable <a href=\"http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/math/#subsup\">styling problems</a> with <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> in web browsers; they tend to produce uneven line spacing as well as qualitatively questionable superscripts. Such issues might not be that relevant in e-book readers, but it might still be safest to use a combined strategy, using <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for italic (it’s rather safe) but CSS for superscripting. This would mean, in the example case, HTML markup like</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=\"sup sgc-2\"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; + \n&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=\"sup\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &amp;minus; 1&lt;/span&gt; + … +\n&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>with CSS like</p>\n\n<pre><code>.sup { position: relative; bottom: 1.8ex; font-size: 80% }\n</code></pre>\n",

So for each 2x2 square of pixels there is one pixel each tinted red, green and blue and one staying in black and white. So effectively you have a resolution of 800x600 with the costs of a 1600x1200 display (plus the costs for the filter).</p>\n\n<p>I think most people use eink devices to read pure text (without many images) and therefore prefer sharper text over colors. Of course this may change if there are more colored ebook devices and subsequently more colorful ebooks offered. It will be a recursive process.</p>\n\n<p>So far it only makes sense to read colored textbooks on colored ink devices. I guess this is why it the new JetBook is manufactured with a 9.7\" display. This may be too large for people who just want a reasonably small device for reading their novels. But the time of colored ebooks will surely come at some point in the future -- probably when the resolution improves further and the colors become more brilliant.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I agree with the main answer -- and in fact I have done it to make one of my books for free permanently. </p>\n\n<p>I just want to add that the Big 6 probably  have separate side agreements with Amazon to allow a certain number of titles to be free. For example, lots of Harlequin novels and first volume of a sci fi series are free. I'm sure the bigger publishers didn't need to try the price-matching technique mentioned above. </p>\n\n<p>That's why by the way a lot of the free titles tend to be by the bigger publishers and that a lot of the \"Free ebook announcements sites/blogs\" are secretly promotional vehicles run by the independent publicists of   the major publishers. </p>\n\n<p>Another thing. Using price match to free to force your Amazon title to be free might not last forever. There's been a lot of pushback in the market as a whole  for example on erotica titles, and also ebooks which are less than 20 pages can bring a frustrating experience for Amazon customers. I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon eventually adopts stricter rules about price matching to free. </p>\n",

I formatted the three elements in the file (two epigraphs and the prologue) as three chapters inside the one file.

The information that is left is low level hardware stuff (like \"SDIO: sdio_card_irq_put\" or register dumps), cronjob notifications (only normal loggers and performance/power, nothing that implies files being sent), daemon start/stops (on reboot), profiling output and several lines about network connections (e.g. <code>Lease of xxx.xxx.0.107 obtained, lease time 604800</code>). All these data is anonymized enough that the only problematic information they could see is, that I jailbroke my Kindle (due to output from the usbnetwork hack).</p></li>\n<li><p><code>test/diags/factory/system_diags.sh</code>, which zips the unfiltered log and stores them somewhere where the user can actually see them (comparable to typing <code>;dumpMessages</code> in the search window).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course these are only the occurrences where the script is called from other scripts.

I've had the nook do similar things with background images, but with the CSS not being an issue (I made a test version of the file with a blank CSS file), it's not that.

It could receive an infected file from the PC, then reinfect the PC the next time you plug it in, even after you clean up the PC. Or a virus on the computer could damage the ereader somehow. I have never heard of any of these things happening <em>so far</em>. But it's only a matter of time; there is malware for platforms like iOS and Android already, so there's no reason to think ereaders are not also targets.</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically, connecting any device to any other device always poses some risks. For example, the United States National Security Agency (NSA) has developed various tracking devices, keystroke loggers, and so on that can be <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/nsas-top-secret-technology-can-tapinfect-computers-even-when-not-connected-to-the-internet\"><strong>hidden inside an otherwise normal USB cable</strong></a>. Unless you build the computer, ereader, and cable from raw metals and plastics, wrote all of the software yourself, and so on, there are always unknown risks in using any electronic device. That's life, and you can't reinvent the wheel just so you can read a book, so the question is: what's the safest bet?</p>\n\n<p>The safe bet here is: never plug any of your devices into a device you can't trust 100%. If you have control over the computer, disinfect it thoroughly with a good virus scanner before plugging in any other devices. If you don't control the computer and don't have confidence that the owner has a good antivirus scanner and maintains the computer properly, don't plug in your device.</p>\n",

KF8 is, of course, the newest version of Amazon's proprietary ebook format.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765211\" rel=\"nofollow\">KindleGen</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kindle Previewer</a> are the two options for creating a KF8 file from an epub file. Kindle Previewer is essentially a graphical interface for KindleGen that comes packaged with a previewer for the various Kindle devices. Personally, I prefer it over KindleGen; the previewing functionality is really handy. That said, don't trust the previewer too far--it will not always accurately represent what the devices will show. It's always best to test on an actual device, if you can.</p>\n\n<p>The guidelines for preparing an epub file for KindleGen/Previewer are found here: <a href=\"https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf</a> (PDF format) In general, having a validating epub 3.0 fixed layout file will get you 95% of the way there, though KF8 introduces some extra functionality like being able to define verso and recto (left and right) pages in a two-page spread, and also region magnification to allow zooming on particular areas of text. There is a sample KF8 fixed layout file available at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Again, be certain that the Fixed Layout epub that you have is the epub 3.0 variety, rather than Apple's iBooks-only fixed layout format. The Apple format came out before the IDPF developed Fixed Layout for epub 3.0, and while Apple's format seems to have served as the basis for the IDPF format, it doesn't necessarily make a valid epub 3.0 file. You can use the online validator here (<a href=\"http://validator.idpf.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://validator.idpf.org/</a>) to test your file to be sure that it's valid.</p>\n\n<p>So, long story short: Amazon does not sell or support epub files of any type, but they do have tools and information available for converting valid epub files to mobi/KF8, including for Fixed Layout books.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps!</p>\n",

This depends on what your goal with your book is—are you planning to sell it, or do you just want to distribute it so that lots of people can read it? If the latter, then yes, text files or PDF are reasonable options (though bear in mind that PDFs by and large are not reflowable, which means that they can be hard to read on devices with small screens, like cell phones).</p>\n\n<p>If you're intending to sell your book, then you need to take into account the policies of the ebook marketplaces you're interested in selling through. The major market out there is, of course, Amazon, and they only sell MOBI/KF8 formats. Barnes &amp; Noble, iBooks, Google Play, and Kobo all sell EPUB files, but even taken all together, Amazon is the larger market. The good news, though, is that in order to create a mobi file, you need a valid EPUB file and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_357613502_3/178-0608866-3969341?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=right-4&amp;pf_rd_r=034TRVKTYBMVWBJNM0HT&amp;pf_rd_t=1401&amp;pf_rd_p=1533579482&amp;pf_rd_i=1000729511\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kindle Previewer</a>, so EPUB will pretty much get you a MOBI/KF8 file as well.</p>\n\n<p>EPUB files are essentially just zipped up collections of HTML pages, so if you're looking for a single-source format, XHTML would be a great choice. Ensuring that it's the more-rigid XHTML will allow for greater transformability of your files, meaning that in the future it will be much easier to run your file through an automated tool that will convert it to whatever the Google Glass ebook format (or whatever) is.</p>\n",

While you can leave out the old toc.ncx and still get a valid epub 3.0 file, for backwards compatability it's best practice to include both toc files--epub 3 readers will ignore the old one, and epub 2 readers will ignore the new one.</p>\n\n<p>As far as bells and whistles go, there are some neat new things: HTML 5 support, including things like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and Javascript support, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>.

The new additions that epub 3.0 bring don't work on the older devices, of course, but the books themselves don't break and are perfectly readable, even if the videos and javascript don't show up.

The font needs to be licensed in such a way as to not just allow use, but also distribution. There are a number of open source fonts available that do permit redistribution--make sure you read the license, though, before using any of them. Many of them will also require that the license be included; it's easy enough to just throw that into the font's directory, but be sure to actually do it if the license requires it.</li>\n<li>Many reading systems (I'm looking at you, Nook) will by default override publisher CSS and use their own instead. If you use fonts as the sole differentiator for different types of information, you'll lose that info when publisher CSS is turned off. If you're using a different font in place of bold for emphasis, consider markup up the text as <code>&lt;b class=\"exclamation\"&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;span class=\"exclamation\"&gt; ... &lt;/span&gt;</code>. Then you can define <code>b.exclamation { Font-weight: normal; font-family: awesome_font; }</code> in your CSS. That will make the text bold if publisher CSS is off, but put it in your awesome font if publisher CSS is working.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Many (myself included) would argue that this is a worthwhile sacrifice. As I mentioned in an answer to <a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/864/can-custom-fonts-be-embedded-in-mobi-or-epub-books-targeting-eink-readers\">a question about embedding fonts</a> in ebooks, many devices will automatically override publisher styles. Even without that, though, the simple ability of users to change fonts on the fly means throwing kerning out the window--text that looks too tightly spaced in Times New Roman may be a little spread out in Bulmer.</p>\n\n<p>Ligatures are another tricky area--one ebook I prepared recently had a font that used ligatures, and while it showed up fine on most of Amazon's devices, on Kindle for PC there were empty rectangles in place of the \"fl\" and \"fi\" ligatures.</p>\n\n<p>Without getting into the justification vs. ragged right argument, Kindle at least will automatically justify your text, and further will take down your book if it receives word that you have forced the body text to display left-aligned.</p>\n\n<p>Hyphenation rules are by and large terrible as well. Most reading systems will at least honor some of the various ways to turn off auto-hyphenation for things like headers, but not all of them do. Discretionary hyphens will usually produce a line break where you put them, but will not always leave a hyphen at the line break, which is decidedly suboptimal.</p>\n\n<p>My business partner and I covered a number of these issues at Tools of Change 2013 a year ago. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/digitalbindery/full-talk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The slides are available at SlideShare.</a> The bits on hyphenation in particular start on slide 38.</p>\n\n<p>The best solution at the moment is to keep styling as simple as possible.

The right to copy is exclusively granted to the author, with a few exceptions such as the right to cite and in some countries the right to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\" rel=\"nofollow\">fair use</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The rights on a book don't have to belong to the author, though. For example, the author may have chosen to transfer (some) of the rights to a publisher.</p>\n\n<h2>The copyright may have expired</h2>\n\n<p>However, copyright doesn't last eternal. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths\" rel=\"nofollow\">A few lifetimes, but not forever</a>.) If enough time has expired from the moment of publication, the book is now in the public domain and may be used freely. An example would be the works of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jules Verne</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, those books weren't originally published as eBooks, but in many countries <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.\" rel=\"nofollow\">if something is an accurate reproduction without changes to the content this would not make it copyrightable because of a lack of originality</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The book might placed in the public domain</h2>\n\n<p>The owner of the copyrights on the book may have chosen to place the book in the [public domain]. In that case, you can freely share the book.</p>\n\n<h2>The copyright owner might have granted you the right to share the book.</h2>\n\n<p>Look for information about the copyright. Besides information in the book itself (usually found at one of the first few pages), you could look for license information at the web site where you downloaded the book.</p>\n\n<p>A few licenses commonly used for content the author wants to be shared are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">GFDL</a> and all the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/#licenses\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creative Commons licenses</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The laws of your country may allow you to share the book</h2>\n\n<p>Some countries may allow books to be shared  with family, for educational purposes etc. It depends on what country you live in. You will have to consult with someone familiar with the laws of your country that are applicable, or look it up yourselves.</p>\n\n<h2>You are not allowed to share it</h2>\n\n<p>If none of the above is the case, you're not allowed to share the book legally. Whether it's morally okay is something you'd probably best answer yourselves.</p>\n",

(I'm a developer at Smashwords.)</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/about/beta\" rel=\"nofollow\">Site Updates</a> page:</p>\n\n<p>\"Charles Dickens is smiling. We updated our Terms of Service yesterday to allow short serials.   We had already relaxed the prior prohibition quite a bit over the last year, because we never felt comfortable making subjective judgements between what was a serial and what was a series.  </p>\n\n<p>The original policy was put in place based on reader feedback, and out of a desire to prevent specific types of abuses, such as a writer taking a full length novel and releasing it as 50 serialized ebooks one 2,000-word chapter at a time.  Or writers releasing unedited works-in-progress that were never completed.  Although rare, we have seen writers do both of these things, and it's clearly not a good customer experience.  However, I do think serializations have their place in the hands of responsible writers, and I believe 99.9% of writers are responsible and do want to serve their readers with a high-value experience.  So after much contemplation, it became clear that we were unfairly limiting the flexibility of the many to protect readers from the few.  In in end, the decision was easy.  Our motto is, \"Your ebook your way.\" </p>\n\n<p>I created Smashwords to open doors, not close doors.  I created Smashwords to give writers the freedom to publish what they want, and give readers the freedom to read what they want.  The Smashwords author is the publisher.  The author is responsible for reader experience, and will be held accountable by their readers.  If they serve their readers well with great, well-packaged writing - whether it's a serial, series, short story or full-length book - then we're all the better for it.  This decision was also made easier by the launch last month of the Smashwords Series Manager, a great tool for authors that helps readers identify all the books in a serial or series. </p>\n\n<p>If you write serials, each episode's cover should be different, even if the only difference is a numeric label such as, \"Episode 5.\"  Beyond that, recommended best practices include: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Link your serials within the Smashwords Series Manager.  </li>\n<li>Clearly identify in your description that it's a serial so you avoid disappointing customers who might think they're purchasing a full length book.  </li>\n<li>In your book title, consider mentioning the episode or part number, such as \"Episode 5,\" or \"Part II,\" etc.  </li>\n<li>Decide in advance how many episodes you'll be releasing.  Make a schedule, communicate the schedule to your fans, and stick to it.  </li>\n<li>Release multiple episodes at once to kick start your readership.  </li>\n<li>Use our new Preorder feature so your fans can purchase upcoming episodes now, at the moment you have their attention and interest.  If you want a great example of preorder serials, check out Ella Ardent's new Dangerous serial, three parts of which are now available on preorder at Apple and others.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You should note, however, that if this is <a href=\"http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2011/03/23/the-dangers-of-private-label-rights-plr-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PLR content</a>  (e.g., someone ELSE's blog, and you bought the rights), this is strictly not allowed.</p>\n",

With the <code>--clean</code> option <code>cjb2</code> does only minimal lossy compression, but if you start out with a multicolor PNG (such as a photo), you will have lost most of the information in the conversion to a bitonal image.</p>\n\n<p>Low color PNG images can be converted first to <code>.ppm</code> (you can do this with the ImageMagick as in Hazzit's answer as well by specifying a <code>.ppm</code> output file name instead of a <code>.pbm</code>) and then use <code>cpaldjvu</code>. This program does simple quantization, and stores this information into multiple layers.</p>\n\n<p>If your PNG has many colors (like in a photo) you will have better results converting the PNG file to JPEG (again with <code>convert</code> and a <code>.jpg</code> output file) and then use that to convert to DjVu. You can e.g. print/convert the PNG to PostScript and use that as input to <code>pdf2djvu</code> that is part of DjVuLibre. The resulting image data is compressed using Wavelet compression and stored in a different layer from the bitonal one mentioned in the previous example.</p>\n\n<p>What route to take depends on the contents of the input file format and the required result, far more than it does on being a PNG file. Especially with the DjVuLibre tools no boilerplate answer can be given, as they <strong>do not help you determine what compression is best for the image</strong> you provide. You implicitly do that by selecting the conversion program (<code>cjb2</code>, <code>cpaldjvu</code> etc).</p>\n\n<p>In my experience the DjVuLibre&mdash;as a reference implementation&mdash;generates correct DjVu files, but it doesn't employ the best compression techniques to generate the output. You might want to look at a  converter that is not based on DjVuLibre, if resulting compression ratio and/or image quality is important. You can use <code>any2djvu</code> to do an online conversion, or one of the other online conversion tools. They do a better analysis of the images to determine what is the best way to compress your image (i.e. what goes in what layer). You can freely experiment with those, but of course you don't know what happens with your data. The commercial Document Express Editor also does a better job, (originally from LizardTech, who also released the DjVuLibre as open source), which was for some time available from <a href=\"http://caminova-inc.software.informer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caminova</a> and now possible from <a href=\"https://www.cuminas.jp/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cuminas</a> </p>\n",

It would be illegal to do the same in Europe, because he did not die at least 70 years ago. In fact for a European it would even be illegal to download them. At least add a disclaimer explaining where it is public domain (see <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg%3aTerms_of_Use\">Project Gutenberg</a> for an example).</li>\n<li><strong>The website may simply be wrong when it claims that the content is public domain.</strong> For example in Germany copyright ends 70 years after the author has died. For this matter translators are authors. For example Antoine de Saint-Exupéry died in 1944, but the German translators of \"The little prince\" died 1952 (or later). So while the original would becomes public domain in 2015 the German translation would not. I guess you would be allowed to translate it yourself and publish your own translation, but I am not sure what implications this would have in countries where the work is not yet public domain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Some things may still not be allowed due to the personal right of the authors, but that is another topic.</p>\n",

For other countries, check the <a href=\"http://www.isbn-international.org/agency\" rel=\"nofollow\">International ISBN site</a>. Many retailers will not require you to have an ISBN&mdash;Amazon, for example, has their own identifier for ebooks. Gramps's answer goes into more detail about which retailers do or do not require ISBNs, so I won't go into that.</p>\n\n<p>When you ask about steps to take before contacting a publisher, I assume that you mean the retailer (such as Amazon, Google, iBooks, etc), as you say that you are intending to self-publish. Before contacting the retailer, it's a good idea to make sure that you have all the information you'll need. That information will include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Title</li>\n<li>Author's name</li>\n<li>cover (in .jpg format)</li>\n<li>description (the back cover copy works fine for this)</li>\n<li>a list of categories the book falls into (most retailers use <a href=\"https://www.bisg.org/complete-bisac-subject-headings-2013-edition\" rel=\"nofollow\">BISAC codes</a> for this)</li>\n<li>ISBN (if you're using them)</li>\n<li>price</li>\n<li>target audience age range</li>\n<li>copyright info</li>\n<li>scope of rights (if you're publishing something you've written yourself, this will be world rights unless you've sold or given away those rights)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You'll also need some financial information, so that you can get paid when your book sells:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bank info (routing number, account number, bank address)</li>\n<li>Credit card information. Some retailers require this so that they can charge you for any returns they get, if your sales in a given period don't cover the returns</li>\n<li>Tax information: a social security number or EIN as appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you go through a traditional publisher rather than self-publishing, the publisher should take care of all the related costs (editing, book design, cover design, ISBNs, marketing, and so on). \"Publishers\" who charge for these services are more often scams than anything else, seeking to relieve authors of excess money.

If you \"buy\" an ebook from Amazon, you don't actually own it--you're just allowed to use it.</li>\n<li>Second, there's the First Sale Doctrine. This is what allows owners to sell print books when they're done with them. At present, it's unclear whether the first sale doctrine applies to digital goods, but the courts seem to be leaning away from letting it, meaning that selling your ebooks when you're done with them is not likely to happen. There's a good writeup on this available here: <a href=\"https://library.osu.edu/blogs/copyright/2013/04/23/the-first-sale-doctrine-and-the-sale-of-digital-goods-in-light-of-kirtsaeng-and-redigi-inc/\">https://library.osu.edu/blogs/copyright/2013/04/23/the-first-sale-doctrine-and-the-sale-of-digital-goods-in-light-of-kirtsaeng-and-redigi-inc/</a>. A relevant excerpt (talking about reselling digital music files, but probably indicative of thoughts about ebooks as well) is:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Capitol Records brought suit against ReDigi on the grounds of\n  copyright infringement. The United States District Court for the\n  Southern District of New York held that ReDigi’s website infringed\n  Capitol Record’s rights of reproduction and distribution, and that the\n  distribution of the digital music files was not covered by the first\n  sale doctrine. The court reasoned that the process of creating a copy\n  of the work on ReDigi’s cloud server was an unauthorized reproduction\n  (the first sale doctrine applies only to lawfully made copies that are\n  distributed, not reproduced) and that because an additional copy was\n  made for the server, users did not distribute or sell the particular\n  copy that they had originally purchased.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As much as we may think they are basically the same thing, ebooks and print books are quite different in a number of ways, and we're still all figuring out the nature of those differences, let alone how to deal with them. It may well be that the entire business model changes enough that the first sale doctrine becomes irrelevant to ebooks&mdash;if ebook subscription services become the primary method of distribution, for example.</p>\n",

Places you will need to reference them include:</p>\n\n<h2>CSS file</h2>\n\n<p>This is just like using fonts on the web: the first thing you need to do is define <code>@font-face</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@font-face {\n  font-family: roboto;\n  src: url('fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf')\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then use that declaration in for whichever styles you'd like to use that font:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p.intro {\n  font-family: roboto;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>content.opf file</h2>\n\n<p>Just like all the other files in your <code>EPUB</code>, you'll need to include any font files you're embedding in the <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> of your <code>.opf</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;item id=\"Roboto-Regular_ttf\" href=\"fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf\" media-type=\"application/x-font-truetype\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above steps are sufficient for most reading systems, but iBooks has one more hoop to jump through:</p>\n\n<h2>com.apple.ibooks.display-options.xml</h2>\n\n<p>This is a file that goes in the <code>META-INF</code> folder of the <code>EPUB</code>, rather than the OEBPS folder, and as the name suggests it's iBooks-specific.

If the first pages is larger, then the other smaller pages will be tiny on a corner of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, how can I scale all pages in a PDF/DJVU document to the same size (preferably the largest size among the pages in the document)?</p>\n\n<p>PS: The files are mainly scanned scientific papers, in DJVU format, though I have to convert them to PDF in order to read them in my ereader.</p>\n",

A series of images in an EPUB file are easier to extract than the corresponding images from a PDF stream. So the handling on your ebook reader should be faster. At least on the systems I tested that is the case ( Sony PRS-700, Sony PRS-T1, Cybook Odyssey HD).</p>\n\n<p>For the actual extraction, scaling and recombination I use a Python based program on Linux that drives standard tools like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdfimages\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>pdfimages</code></a> and <a href=\"http://djvu.sourceforge.net/doc/man/ddjvu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>ddjvu</code></a> for the extraction, <a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>imagemagick</code></a> for the scaling/conversion, and does the recombination into EPUB itself.</p>\n\n<p>Of course the last step could easily be changed to the recombination into a PDF file using <a href=\"http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reportlab</a>.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftk\">pdftk</a>, the PDF toolkit, is a program that has been around since 2004, and is available for multiple platforms: Windows, Linux, OSX. Although you could probably compile (it is open source) and run it on some (Android based) ebook readers, it is more intended to be run on your main computer, to change files before loading them onto your ebook reader.</p>\n\n<p><code>pdftk</code> can do a lot of things out-of-the-box: collate scanned PDF pages (including handling reverse ordered back sides); decrypt and encrypt PDFs; joining and splitting of PDFs; removing of pages; rotating (90&deg; increments) of pages; reporting on PDF metatdata and bookmarks.</p>\n\n<p><code>pdftk</code> is built on top of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IText\">iText</a> java library. It's development history is documented by its <a href=\"http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-version-history/\">revision history</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Installation</h1>\n\n<h2>Windows</h2>\n\n<p>For <strong>Windows</strong> (XP, Vista, 7, 8), use the installer that you can get directly from the <a href=\"http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/\">pdftk pages at PDF Labs</a>. Run the executable installer, you should select the option [Don't create a Start Menu Folder]², but make sure you leave [Add application directory to your environment path] selected.</p>\n\n<p>Now you can open the Command Prompt (in the \"Accessories\" program group) and type³:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pdftk --version\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to make sure the program is correctly installed. You can now use the examples provided in the answers that were mentioned in the question.</p>\n\n<h2>OSX</h2>\n\n<p>You can download the Mac OS X installer (for Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion) from <a href=\"http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/\">pdftk pages at PDF Labs</a>, or use <a href=\"https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask\">homebrew-cask</a> as explained in <a href=\"https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask\">this StackOverflow answer</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>brew cask install pdftk\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After that, open a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28OS_X%29\">Terminal</a> and type</p>\n\n<pre><code>pdftk --version\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to make sure the program is correctly installed. You can now use the examples provided in the answers that were mentioned in the question.</p>\n\n<h2>Linux</h2>\n\n<p>Most Linux distributions include <code>pdftk</code>, try</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install pdftk\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo yum install pdftk\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or pick another installer appropriate to the distribution.</p>\n\n<p>After installation, open a terminal (if not already open for the installation process) or switch to a console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>) and type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pdftk --version\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to make sure the program is correctly installed. You can now use the examples provided in the answers that were mentioned in the question.</p>\n\n<h1>Usage</h1>\n\n<p><code>pdftk</code> is not hindered by a graphical user interface, therefore it is easy to automate repetitive tasks⁴. The examples in the answers, e.g.: </p>\n\n<pre><code> pdftk *.pdf cat output ../combined.pdf\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(to combine multiple PDF files in one file), can be copied and pasted from your web browser into your command prompt/terminal.</p>\n\n<p>To find out about other easy ways to manipulate your PDF files, try:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pdftk --help\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-man-page/\">manual pages</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When in a hurry, and only having to do things once, it is sometimes easier to burst a while PDF into individual pages with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pdftk in.pdf burst\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then remove the pages you don't need anymore, or rearrange them by renaming them, and then combine them using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pdftk pg_*.pdf cat output out.pdf\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(this combines the pages in alphabetical order so if you want the original page 2 to go after page 3, just rename <code>pg_0002.pdf</code> to <code>pg_0003a.pdf</code>).</p>\n\n<p>¹ <sub>If you don't mind doing repetitive tasks moving a mouse around, there is also a GUI based version of the program: PDFtk Free</sub><br>\n² <sub>That only creates a superfluous entry in the Program menu with an Uninstall option, you can do that from the \"Add/Remove Programs\" in the Control Panel</sub><br>\n³ <sub>If you are not familiar with using the commandline: you have to type the characters shown and at the end of the line press <kbd>Enter</kbd></sub><br>\n⁴ <sub>For instance by calling it from a batch file, a shell script or (my favourite) a Python program</sub><br></p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I am creating an ebook for Amazon's Kindle in HTML, and then later use KindleGen to convert it into the Kindle's MOBI version. </p>\n\n<p>The problem I am currently having is with custom bullets for nested unordered lists that I am using for the ebook's Table of Contents. Initially I was using an image in the list-style-image property to create a custom bullet. This was the CSS I was using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul.customBullet\n{\n    list-style-image: url('images/bulletPointImage.png');\n    margin:1.3em;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this was the html:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul class =\"customBullet\"&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Text 1&lt;b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;!-- 1st tier --&gt;\n       &lt;ul class=\"customBullet\"&gt;\n         &lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:&lt;b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;1-- 2nd tier --&gt;\n             &lt;ul class=\"customBullet\"&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Text 3&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;!-- 3rd tier --&gt;\n                    &lt;ul class=\"customBullet\"&gt;\n                       &lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"#chap1\"&gt; Text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;!-- 4th tier --&gt;\n                    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n                &lt;/li&gt; \n            &lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;3: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;4: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;5: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;6: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;7: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n       &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was having problems with aligning the bullets with the text. The text appeared one line below the bullet and a little to the left and not alongside as it should (in Firefox). When I previewed the MOBI created with KindleGen in KindlePreviewer, the image of the bullet was coming out tiny (and not proportional to the image file) and the same problem of the bullet not positioned in the same line as the text. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the bullets appear differently in each of the different kindle models (Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire, etc.), the size of the image varied and with different sort of spacing between the bullet and the text. </p>\n\n<p>I then read somewhere online that Kindle does not support the list-style-image tag. Kindle's official supported CSS tags also do not include it. So I created a simple bulleted list without the CSS but with the same html code above. The problem is the same with the spacing. And different shaped bullets appear on each tier. For example a hollow circular one on the first, a squarish one on the second and so on. </p>\n\n<p>So, my question is , is there a way (any lines of code) to make streamlined bullets in html for kindle's ebook without all these variations in different versions, and also without all these unneeded space insertions, and a proper sort of positioning. Bullets that stay the same no matter which version of kindle is being used. Hope I have explained myself properly. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Your best bet is to start with a solid epub file and run that through either KindleGen or Kindle Previewer. Other tools such as Sigil and Calibre are convenient, but often cause problems down the road by inserting their own bits of code. If you want to be certain that you know what is causing your problems, it's always best to do it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The single best resource for creating a solid, valid epub file is the IDPF's <a href=\"http://idpf.org/epub/30\">epub 3.0 specification</a>. Once you feel like you've gotten it pretty close, use <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/\">epubcheck</a> to find and iron out the kinks. A valid epub 3.0 file should transform seamlessly into a valid mobi/KF8. Once you have the valid epub, you can begin your Kindle-specific styling. Make sure you pay attention to the specific requirements of the <a href=\"http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf\">Kindle Publishing Guidelines</a> when you are doing so.</p>\n\n<p>For basic getting started guides, you might check out Harrison Ainsworth's \"<a href=\"http://www.hxa.name/articles/content/epub-guide_hxa7241_2007.html\">EPUB Format Construction Guide</a>.\" It's a bit dated by now, and only deals with epub 2.0.1, but it will cover the basics pretty well. O'Reilly has a book on <em><a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024897.do\">EPUB 3 Best Practices</a></em> that's not too shabby, but it might go into more detail than you need to get started.</p>\n\n<p>Do a bit of reading, but not too much, and then find a non-DRM'ed epub file and tear it apart (just change the filename from .epub to .zip and unzip it) to see what makes it tick. Change stuff, re-zip is (how you do that will depend on the operating system you use) run it through epubcheck, and see what error messages you get. Getting a valid book is quite doable with minimal experience.</p>\n\n<p>As far as styling goes: there are lots of quirks in reading systems and devices. If you want to only do Kindle, you're cutting out a lot of potential issues, but each of Amazon's devices has its own quirks as well, so be prepared to test a lot, and ask lots of questions when problems come up.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck!</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>TL;DR; In order not to worry about the output, you have to be sure of the input and the translation process into an ebook. The input has to show you everything that is there and hide nothing, and the translation process must be deterministic.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you only need basic formatting and want it to be consistently converted, the best you can do is use a mark-up language like <a href=\"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\">reStructured Text</a>, <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">markdown</a> or <a href=\"http://www.docbook.org/\">DocBook</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this is that common word processors like Word¹ are what-you-see-is-all-you've-got: you often have no idea what the internal structure of a document is even though it shows \"right\" on the screen. </p>\n\n<p>This happens e.g. when you have three words in italics, and select the middle one and set italics again. Is the internal structure such that italics ends after the first word and begins at the third; or does it end at the beginning of the second word (after the space) and start at the end of the second before the space; or is the second word just italics and does italics within italics mean: display non-italics? And what happens to this structure when you then deleted the second word?²</p>\n\n<p>With a mark-up language the mark-up is explicit and you see what you do: where things start, where things end. The translation of mark-up gets you the same result every time, and that makes it predictable. And predictable means you know what you get as an end-result and you don't have to check it. At least it should not be a result after the first time using some construct ;-).</p>\n\n<p>The preceeding isn't necessarily true for two documents that look the same in Word: they might have different internal structures, which translate to different output in an ebook.</p>\n\n<p>For many people this is not a problem, as to how this differs depends on the the target ebook format. Formats that do less rendering of <strong>structure</strong> (such as image based ebook formats like DjVu, or typesetting oriented formats like PDF and DVI (LaTeX output)) are similar to output to a printer. Word has control over this, and makes it look the same whether it renders to screen, to the printer or to PDF. That is why you normally have no visual difference directly printing from Word, or generating a PDF and printing that.</p>\n\n<p>This can be different  if your input text is translated in another mark-up, as in ebooks in EPUB, MOBI, etc. format. In that case knowing exactly what structure you started with is important as that may influence the output rendering. And that is where Word could get a different output for similar looking input, because there might be hidden elements, but something in a mark-up language will be the same if it looks the same, because there is nothing that is hidden.</p>\n\n<p>The aforementioned example, which looks the same in Word could translate in one of the following HTML pieces (there are more possibilities, and this might be an oversimplification, but the I hope it conveys the principle):</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;i&gt;abc&lt;/i&gt; def &lt;i&gt;ghi&lt;/i&gt;</code> &rarr; <i>abc</i> def <i>ghi</i><br>\n<code>&lt;i&gt;abc &lt;/i&gt;def&lt;i&gt; ghi&lt;/i&gt;</code> &rarr; <i>abc </i>def<i> ghi</i><br>\n<code>&lt;i&gt;abc &lt;i&gt;def&lt;/i&gt; ghi&lt;/i&gt;</code> &rarr; <i>abc <i>def</i> ghi</i></p>\n\n<p>If the output was to be LaTeX instead of HTML (where italics in italics switches back to non-italics) the third would look the same as the first two, and the inter-word spacing would differ after italics ends (it might be different in HTML rendering by Firefox as well, I just can't see it).</p>\n\n<p>The conversion process should be deterministic, and it probably is for your purposes. However Knuth did do the calculation in TeX in integers because he argued that the floating point units in computers (at that time) where not deterministic enough because of rounding differences. IIRC this was to get the same result on different computers, so this is—hopefully—only an example of to what extremes people go to control the repeatability of their output.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For conversion of mark-up, have a look at <a href=\"http://sphinx-doc.org/\">Sphinx</a> or <a href=\"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\">pandoc</a>. The former can generate output in PDF without having to install LaTeX, the latter has more in- and output formats. Both can generate HTML which you might use as a basis for MOBI as I have not seen any direct generation towards that of mark-up languages (but since I don't have a MOBI device, I have not really looked for that).</p>\n\n<p>¹ <sub>I use Word here, but this applies to OpenOffice writer and similar editors as well</sub><br></p>\n\n<p>² <sub>I fear too many of us have edited documents only to have new text at the cursor have some font or formatting that we did not expect and is a result of some program internal formatting lurking invisible.</sub><br></p>\n",

But really, this is not tested in any court as far as I know, and nobody really knows. I don't think inheritance is legally the same as receiving a present or purchasing, so it could be that the heir just inherits the role of the deceased. Unfortunately, I suspect that my heirs wouldn't be that much interested in the eBooks that I own :-(</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I doubt that your nationality makes any difference. </p>\n",

Depending on the e-retailer there are some programs you can sign-up for that will help drive a sell, such as package deals.

Some people think that it's OK to price retail for print when some people refuse to pay the same price for a physical item compared to a digital copy.  One of my dislikes with ebooks compared to print is the design around them. Some people think that as long as I take my well designed print book and copy all the text and drop it into a <code>.doc</code> file I can generate an <code>.epub</code> or <code>.mobi</code> file out of it then charge a bloated fee when you don't get the same quality as a printed or even own the rights to it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For geographical context, this question is about books sales in the\n  northeastern areas of the United States.

The downfall with many stores is the gouge to sell your title and that will play a factor on where you buy your book and the price.</p>\n",

From my understanding, <code>.svg</code> format can be a less file size than exporting the illustration as <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.png</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>If images:</h2>\n\n<p>I would use <code>.png</code> files because they can be compressed and help reduce your file size.

It is common for illustrators to use fixed layout to control how the illustration is viewed.  This is common with children's books.  </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>This sounds like a problem with the CSS that Calibre is generating for the epub file. Without seeing the code, it's impossible to say for sure, but my guess is that it's got the width and height for images both set to 100%, which would distort the images in the way you're describing. The answer is to simply remove the height declaration, which will make the images full width of whatever height is appropriate given their aspect ratio.</p>\n\n<p>I don't use Calire, so I can't tell you how to use that tool to do this, but if you're comfortable editing HTML and CSS, all you'll need to do is crack open the epub file (rename it from .epub to .zip, then unzip it), find the images being affected in the HTML, figure out which selectors the CSS is targeting them with, and go change the relevant CSS declarations.</p>\n",

There's plenty more info that can (and should) go in there, of course, but you asked for minimums. We'll start with file structure:  in the root directory, there's one mimetype file and two folders--the OEBPS and the META-INF. Here's the mimetype file contents:</p>\n\n<pre><code>application/epub+zip\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>be sure not to have any return/line break characters in there.\nIn the META-INF folder, there's one file, the container.xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;container version=\"1.0\" xmlns=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:container\"&gt;\n  &lt;rootfiles&gt;\n    &lt;rootfile full-path=\"OEBPS/content.opf\" media-type=\"application/oebps-package+xml\"/&gt;\n  &lt;/rootfiles&gt;\n&lt;/container&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the OEBPS folder, things get slightly more complex. First is the content.opf file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?&gt;\n&lt;package xmlns=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" unique-identifier=\"db-id\" version=\"3.0\"&gt;\n\n&lt;metadata&gt;\n    &lt;dc:title id=\"t1\"&gt;Title&lt;/dc:title&gt;\n    &lt;dc:identifier id=\"db-id\"&gt;isbn&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=\"dcterms:modified\"&gt;2014-03-27T09:14:09Z&lt;/meta&gt;\n    &lt;dc:language&gt;en&lt;/dc:language&gt;\n&lt;/metadata&gt;\n\n&lt;manifest&gt;\n    &lt;item id=\"toc\" properties=\"nav\" href=\"toc.xhtml\" media-type=\"application/xhtml+xml\" /&gt;\n    &lt;item id=\"ncx\" href=\"toc.ncx\" media-type=\"application/x-dtbncx+xml\" /&gt;\n    &lt;item id=\"template_css\" href=\"template.css\" media-type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;item id=\"hello\" href=\"1_hello.xhtml\" media-type=\"application/xhtml+xml\" /&gt;\n&lt;/manifest&gt;\n\n&lt;spine toc=\"ncx\"&gt;\n    &lt;itemref idref=\"hello\" /&gt;\n&lt;/spine&gt;\n\n&lt;/package&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then comes the toc.xhtml file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;toc.xhtml&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;link href=\"template.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n    &lt;nav id=\"toc\" epub:type=\"toc\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 class=\"frontmatter\"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;ol class=\"contents\"&gt;\n               &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"1_hello.xhtml\"&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ol&gt;\n\n    &lt;/nav&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And finally we have the content of the ebook itself, in this case 1_hello.xhtml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;1_hello.xhtml&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;link href=\"template.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a bonus, there's a toc.ncx file. This is not required to be valid, but it's required if you want the book to have a working Table of Contents on epub 2.0.1 devices (which is pretty much all of them):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?&gt;\n&lt;ncx version=\"2005-1\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/\"&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"dtb:uid\" content=\"isbn\"/&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"dtb:depth\" content=\"1\"/&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;docTitle&gt;\n    &lt;text&gt;&lt;/text&gt;\n&lt;/docTitle&gt;\n\n&lt;navMap&gt;\n    &lt;navPoint id=\"hello\" playOrder=\"1\"&gt;\n        &lt;navLabel&gt;&lt;text&gt;cover&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/navLabel&gt;\n        &lt;content src=\"1_hello.xhtml\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/navPoint&gt;\n&lt;/navMap&gt;\n\n&lt;/ncx&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And there's also the template.css in there, which is just a CSS stylesheet. In this case, it looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>h1 {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that's it!

JavaScript support is more or less confined to iBooks at present, and the only system that uses media queries that I know of is Kindle, and they only support the <code>amzn-mobi</code> and <code>amzn-kf8</code> selectors. A few reading systems will support some CSS 3 elements like <code>border-radius</code>, but mostly you're stuck with the older stuff. On top of that, many reading systems (like the nook) will by default ignore the publisher's CSS file completely and use their own stylesheet instead.</p>\n\n<p>If what you're looking for from responsive design is the text conforming to the screen size, though, you can certainly achieve that through good markup and simple CSS. Make your markup as semantic as possible, and use semantic elements rather than styles, since many systems will ignore, for example, a style that bolds some text, but will happily bold anything in a <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag. If you're going for a wide array of devices, keep things as simple as possible.

    "body": "<p>Yes, you can use internal links in ePub files. Depending on which tool you use to generate your ePubs (I prefer Sigil), you can develop the individual internal files using HTML directly. So you can create a link with an <code>&lt;a href=\"\"&gt;</code> tag just as you would in a webpage. This is often used in creating custom tables of contents, or links to footnotes.</p>\n\n<p>To your edit: raw manually-edited ePub files are exactly the same in structure and syntax as HTML files (I'm assuming you're generating an archive of .xhtml files), so you can definitely include links just as you would when writing a webpage. If you want to link within the same page, you'll need the <code>&lt;a name=\"foo\"&gt;</code> marker for the target, and then <code>&lt;a href=\"#foo\"&gt;</code> for the link. To link to a different page, just include the page name as the target for the href instead.</p>\n",

The structure of the text could look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p class=\"body\"&gt;Here is a bunch of text with a footnote &lt;a epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"notes.xhtml#note1\" class=\"reference\" id=\"ref1\"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With a matching note in a notes.xhtml file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;aside epub:type=\"rearnote\" class=\"note\" id=\"note1\"&gt;1: Here is the related endnote &lt;a href=\"ch1.xhtml#ref1\"&gt;[link back]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are a few best practices to consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to give a reciprocal link for endnotes--that is, once you can click on the number to go read the endnote, you'll need another link to bring you back to the text from the endnote</li>\n<li>In the index, it's very handy to have a series of links at the top for each alphabetic subsection, so that a reader can select \"G\" and go to the \"G\" section of the index. The \"G\" subheader can then be a link back to the top of the index.</li>\n<li>If you're using epub 3.0, you should definitely add <code>epub:type</code> semantic markup for indices and foot/end notes. The details of that can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/\">Structural Semantics Vocabulary</a>. These semantics enable reading systems to associate behaviors with certain kinds of content. This is what iBooks uses to generate <a href=\"http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2012/05/creating-pop-up-footnotes-in-epub-3-and.html\">popup footnotes</a>, and if you've properly marked up your content, you're giving it the chance to get additional features with no more effort as reading systems design more functionality for that markup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indices can be pretty painful to create if the production files weren't tagged correctly at the time of creation; one quick-and-dirty method to consider in that case is to insert <code>&lt;span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"page1\" /&gt;</code> into the document at each page break, then have the index link to the print page. This isn't ideal, as a print page can span multiple screens (particularly on a cell phone!), but it can get you part way there if you're interested in cutting corners.</p>\n",

Boom, stuck in there. I wanted to put it on my iPad and eventually I managed but was it worth it? Meh, not sure...</p>\n\n<p>First I had to get rid of DRM - I am a Mac user, so I used Mac DRM removal. Questions here: <em>Is it legal? Is it right?</em> \n-- I didn't share it with anyone but I was not sure. It required that the book was on the reader downloaded and it needed the serial number of the reader. Because only with that the software was able to remove it.</p>\n\n<p>For you, I suggest reading <a href=\"http://tips4linux.com/remove-drm-from-amazon-kindles-ebooks-using-linux/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for getting the tools for the workflow I described above. And then I suggest reading also <a href=\"http://tips4linux.com/convert-ebooks-in-linux/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for converting the book formats. However...as I said - the work was simply not worth it. I still read the books most of the times on my Kindle only. Once I read them I don't come back to them so why would I store them anywhere else?</p>\n",

It is the one piece of software that has dramatically improved my experience on my Kindle this year (and I already use great software such as Briss, Librerator and Kranf's Kindle Collection Manager).</p>\n\n<p>GrabMyBooks lets you gradually build an ebook in a separate Firefox tab by selecting web pages or content as you go. You can add pages one by one by right-clicking on the page and selecting \"Grab this Page\". If you only want part of a page, you can also select text and grab it. And you can also select multiple links and grab them, which is very convenient if you are interested in multiple blog posts.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when you grab a web page for your ebook, there are many components of the page you do not want: the sidebars, the comments and so on. GrabMyBooks is pretty good at guessing which content you want, but it sometimes gets it wrong. In these cases, it's very useful to be able to select the text you want, right-click and choose \"Grab selected text\".</p>\n\n<p>By default, GrabMyBooks creates an Epub. But in the Settings, you can tell it to create a mobi file. For GrabMyBooks to create mobi files, you must have Calibre installed. You then tell GrabMyBooks where Calibre is installed. This may sound like a lot of work, but configuring GrabMyBooks properly is well worth it if you want a luxury experience of creating ebooks from web content on the fly.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, there is a setting where you specify the default save directory. Well, I have it save my ebooks directly to my Kindle's \"documents\" folder.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there is an option where GrabMyBooks saves an Epub file in addition to the mobi file. This allows you to later load the Epub book in GrabMyBooks and edit it again, adding or deleting web pages. In the settings, you can set a directory where the software will save Epubs, since your default format will be mobi. </p>\n\n<p>I recommend always editing the Metadata setting before grabbing your book so that it displays with a nice title and author name.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you like it as much as I do.</p>\n",

As long as you're only interested in adding some styles to the text, though, you should be fine. Where you start to run into problems is if you want to have lots of other stuff going on in your ToC, like a number of images. Here's a quote from the <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def\" rel=\"nofollow\">relevant section</a> of the epub 3 spec:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The optional heading must be followed by a single ol ordered list; no\n  other elements are permitted as direct children of the nav element.\n  This ordered list represents the primary level of content navigation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Each list item ( li ) of the ordered list represents a primary\n  heading, structure or other point of interest within the EPUB\n  Publication and must contain either a child a element or a child span\n  element. The a element describes the target within the Content\n  Document that the link points to. The span element serves as a heading\n  for breaking down lists into distinct groups (for example, a large\n  list of illustrations can be segmented into several lists, one for\n  each chapter).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So as long as all you're doing is enclosing parts of the list items in <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s you'll be fine and won't need to create a separate visual ToC. If for some reason you do need to create a separate visual ToC, I would advise only including the visual one in the <code>&lt;spine&gt;</code>. The reading system will use as the logical ToC whichever file has <code>properties=\"nav\"</code> declared in the <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as using <code>list=style-type: none;</code> goes: technically, you shouldn't need it, but it doesn't hurt at all to include it, and some reading systems will include numbers if you don't use it. So yes, by all means include that statement. It will cause no problems with KindleGen.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the frustrating note: be sure that you also include an epub 2.0-style toc.ncx file. It's perfectly <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#ncx-superseded\" rel=\"nofollow\">valid to do so</a> in epub 3.0, and it's the only way that epub 2.0 reading systems will be able to make use of your table of contents. Yes, this means that if you have a visual ToC separate from the logical toc.xhtml, you're now up to three tables of contents in your file.</p>\n",

It might not be a bad idea to check out the files on other reading systems (there are a myriad of free desktop reading systems, like the Chrome extension <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readium/fepbnnnkkadjhjahcafoaglimekefifl?hl=en-US\" rel=\"nofollow\">Readium</a>, the Firefox <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EPUBReader</a> add-on, and good old <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Digital Editions</a>). If the images don't show up in those systems either, it's probably a problem in the ebook file rather than with your device.</p>\n\n<p>For scientific texts, I would advise that you check to be sure the reading system supports MathML, which will allow properly formatted equations to show up as readable, searchable text. Note that for MathML to work, the manuscript must have been formatted properly, and since not all reading systems support MathML, not all publishers necessarily bother with it. Since this is a chicken/egg problem, I'd advocate picking up a MathML reader and making sure to harass publishers that don't use MathML until they do. You can use the support grid at <a href=\"http://epubtest.org/results/?view=detail\" rel=\"nofollow\">epubtest.org</a> to find MathML-capable systems, but most of that information is geared toward tablets.</p>\n\n<p>For reflowing not working where there are formulas or graphics&mdash;do you mean that the images (and formulas that aren't MathML are frequently just images, to preserve formatting) aren't expanding in size when the font is increased, for example? That's something that you'll see in any ebook reader, I'm afraid. The best you can do there is get something with a good zoom feature, which unfortunately argues against eInk devices.</p>\n\n<p>Display size is probably the easiest single criteria to look into, though it's also fairly subjective&mdash;what's fine for you to read my be too cramped for me.  As mentioend above, zooming is going to be somewhat problematic on any eInk device, as the refresh rate for eInk is much slower than for a tablet screen. If tablets are absolutely not an option, you might want to look around for eInk readers with large displays; a quick search found me <a href=\"http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/the-best-large-screen-e-readers\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck with your search!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Here's a good summary of which reading systems support MathML: <a href=\"http://www.mathjax.org/resources/epub-readers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mathjax.org/resources/epub-readers/</a></p>\n",

For that, the free software BRISS works very well as it selects crop areas close to the text, areas that you are free to adjust. As far as reflowing and zooming I can only speak about the Kindle DX. Out of the box the Kindle DX, now a four-year-old device, is low on features, but its large screen and built-in keyboard make it an attractive contender. When I read a PDF that puts too much strain on the standard Amazon software, I read the document in Librerator, which is alternate software for the DX. It has wonderful zooming and shortcuts, but I'm not sure the reflowing will be adequate for your needs. It is a bit tricky to install and will probably void the warranty. </p>\n\n<p>The best would be if you could test a document on various readers already owned by people in your local area. </p>\n",

I consider DjVu the better alternative for scanned multi-page documents, especially for efficiency reasons. Compared to the JPEG encoded pages you get in PDF or TIFF files you often have a 20x smaller file size.</p>\n\n<p>For non-professional users this size difference often is not a problem, but for dessimination in the professional world it is. Just imagine having to buy 20x more storage and increased network capacity. Because a PDF reader is already necessary for many other documents (other than scanned), such users already have a PDF reader and I have seen a reluctance with non-professionals to install something just to be able to handle a more efficient file format.</p>\n\n<p>DjVu is hindered by sub-par open source implementations of the encoder and AFAIK also by patent issues. My expectation is that at some point some replacement technology will become available that has all of the advantage and non of the problems, just like PNG replaced GIF. That will be a multilayer encoded image format.</p>\n\n<p>As long as I will have some decent, commandline, conversion software for DjVu, PDF and any other format, I don't see any of that as a problematic. It would only be nice if I could tell Thunderbird which users only have a PDF reader so that I could attach DjVu and it would convert it to PDF before sending the email...</p>\n",

Amazon encourages content creators to use\n  creative styles for headings, special paragraphs, footnotes, tables of\n  contents, etc., but not for body text. The reason for this is that any\n  styling on body text in the HTML will override the user’s preferred\n  default reading settings. Users report such behavior as a poor reading\n  experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While at the same time in Guideline 3.1.9 , it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The primary or main font in a book should be set at the  level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be a bit contradictory, the first one seem to say that we can't change the font style (I take it to include specifying font family as well), and the second one says we can, can we or can we not specify a body font ? Am I misunderstanding this in some way ?</p>\n\n<p>Also, another confusion that I have is with regards to inserting indentation in paragraphs in the Kindle ebooks. The guideline concerning this goes like this in Amazon Publishing Guidelines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>KindleGen automatically indents the first line of every paragraph by\n  default. To change this behavior, use the text-indent style on the\n  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, when I try to change the text-indent property to my <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags , just to check how it works, it has no effect whatsoever on the indent on the paragraphs, what could be happening ? And even with no text-indent added, it doesn't seem like Amazon is inserting any default indentation, I mean I can't see it while previewing in Kindle Previewer.</p>\n",

To create a DjVu file, the initial image\n  is first separated into three images: a background image, a foreground\n  image, and a mask image. The background and foreground images are\n  typically lower-resolution color images (e.g., 100 dpi); the mask\n  image is a high-resolution bilevel image (e.g., 300 dpi) and is\n  typically where the text is stored. The background and foreground\n  images are then compressed using a wavelet-based compression algorithm\n  named IW44.[5] The mask image is compressed using a method called JB2\n  (similar to JBIG2). The JB2 encoding method identifies nearly\n  identical shapes on the page, such as multiple occurrences of a\n  particular character in a given font, style, and size. It compresses\n  the bitmap of each unique shape separately, and then encodes the\n  locations where each shape appears on the page. Thus, instead of\n  compressing a letter \"e\" in a given font multiple times, it compresses\n  the letter \"e\" once (as a compressed bit image) and then records every\n  place on the page it occurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for converting a djvu to a pdf without increasing the size, there is a program that claims it can do so called <a href=\"http://www.stdutility.com/stduconverter.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scientific and Technical Document Utility</a> (it is not free).

    "body": "<p>The short answer is: PDF is not a good format for storing image data. The only reason that it is often used for doing so, is that it is one of the few formats (the other more well known ones are DjVu and TIFF), that allow you to store multiple (scanned) images in a single file. </p>\n\n<p>The longer answer is that the possible storage of image data in PDF files is done in a less efficient way than is possible in the way DjVu does. So in general, unless the DjVu file is compressed inefficiently to start with, you will <strong>always</strong> get a bigger PDF file, or you get a much worse quality image. </p>\n\n<p>The primary difference, apart from algorithms used for compression, is that an image in a DjVu file consists of multiple layers, each compressed separately, with optimized algorithms for the layer's data (monotone, color etc.), and recombined for display/printing. Especially on a page with characters (not selectable text associated with the characters) combined with images DjVu easily gets 20x smaller files at similar lossy quality. </p>\n",

The technology basically uses microcapsules filled with white and black charged particles. The charged particles are manipulated by electrodes at the top and bottom of the capsule. When the top contains only white particles, the pixel is white. As more black particles are added, the pixel becomes darker until it becomes completely black.</p>\n\n<p>The main advantage of eInk displays are that they offer superb contrast even in bright light (try reading a cell phone on the beach while wearing sunglasses). The primary disadvantage is that these displays are very slow relative to LCD, which makes them unsuitable for high frame rate applications such as video and many games.</p>\n\n<p>e-readers are one application where high contrast is useful and high frame rates are not necessary, and so they have become the primary use of electronic paper technologies.</p>\n",

However, one big problem I'm having is that it somehow deleted the <em>KaiTi（楷体）</em> Chinese font it originally had, leaving only <em>SongTi（宋体）</em> and <em>Heiti（黑体）</em> as possible choices. Those fonts have a very tight line spacing which makes for a difficult reading experience. </p>\n\n<p>I read from users who register at Chinese Amazon that the updated Kindle Paperwhite should automatically download <em>KaiTi（楷体）</em> and <em>YuanTi（圆体）</em> once it's connected to network. However it's not happening to me. If I have to deregister my Kindle and re-register it at Chinese Amazon just for the sake of fonts, it'll be quite a pain, not to mention I'll probably have to re-download all the books I have in US Amazon account, plus the potential loss of some reading progress. Therefore, is there some way to update the Chinese fonts on a Kindle PW which is registered at US Amazon? Thanks in advance!</p>\n",

I either receive gibberish (particularly when it comes to mathematical formulas) or else strange line breaks that make it difficult to follow the flow of the text, or both.\nThis doesn't help the fact that I have to concentrate more anyways as the texts are not in my native language (I'm studying abroad in Germany).\nReading pdfs on my Kindle is also not a viable option, as the constant moving back and forth over the page breaks my concentration as well.</p>\n\n<p>I remember reading somewhere that converting to HTML, cleaning the code, and then converting to epub/mobi was suggested, but I can't find the article again and I wasn't sure what to do after converting the pdf to html (which seemed to work decently, and the HTML version looks good enough in my browser, besides small, rare garbled parts where certain mathematical symbols or special characters were, which I could live with and aren't of importance for non-math courses anyways).\nI would also be open to other roundabout ways of conversion (over an Open Office/Word text document, for instance) as long as the quality is good and easily readable.</p>\n\n<p>As a student my budget doesn't really include commercial optical character recognition software. Can anyone help with this issue?</p>\n",

It's still in beta, has a few bugs, wrt the TOC, and the documentation and support for it are pretty terrible but it does a few things very well, one of which is zoom-able panels.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I recommend, save your PDF into discrete JPEGS, you can do this through the file save menu and then load all those individual JPEGS into the comic creator, it has a guided set up process when you open the app and begin a new book, very simple, it will load all your JPEGS in chronological order.  You can then run a detect all panels command and it basically will detect where items in the page are grouped together.</p>\n\n<p>For each of these panels you will be able to zoom straight to that content, making for very easy reading.  You can also edit the dimensions of the panels if the computer is detecting badly.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have the panels where you want just export and compile to .mobi, it has a feature for this in the app of course.  Keep in mind this will be a fixed format ebook still but with the zoom feature it should be much easier to read and can be easily exported to .mobi format and loaded on your kindle.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p><em>Copied from an identical <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/24472753/700471\">Stack Overflow Question</a>. (Didn't know there's an eBooks stack exchange now, woot!)</em></p>\n\n<h2>The Puzzle</h2>\n\n<p>I am working on an eBook file, or series of files, which should be compatible with the maximum range of eReaders on the market.  This would include, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The e-ink Kindle family</li>\n<li>The Kindle App on iOS, Android (including Kindle Fire) and anywhere else</li>\n<li>iBooks for iOS</li>\n<li>The Nook</li>\n<li>The Nook App for iOS, Android, and anywhere else</li>\n<li>Kobo, possibly (haven't looked into this much)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So we're going for maximum compatibility with different eReaders, I hope that's clear.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here's the issue:</p>\n\n<p><em>The eBook file has a unique custom glossary which should be easily accessible to the reader.</em></p>\n\n<p>Although it is one thing to have a glossary in the back of the eBook, all of the modern eReaders have some kind of dictionary functionality that is very accessible (put your cursor on a word, long-press on a word, etc.) so the glossary needs to be just as accessible to encourage usage by readers.</p>\n\n<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>\n\n<p>One way to do this would be hyperlinking each (or the first) occurrence of a term to the glossary entry in the back, and having hyperlinks in the glossary that go back to the occurrence(s).</p>\n\n<p>Hyperlinks are supported by EPUB, as well as MOBI / AZN / KF8 / etc. for Kindle.  The links can be styled so that they are unobtrusive (not underlined, dark gray or black, etc.)  </p>\n\n<p><strong>This is the best solution I have been able to concoct so far.</strong></p>\n\n<p>However, having the hyperlinked words look different from the rest of the text could be distracting to the reader.  If I use this method, and the hyperlinks are styled to look like the rest of the text, the reader will not know whether to navigate (press) so they will simply use the built-in dictionary (long-press).</p>\n\n<p><em>(Also note that the newest Kindle software (latest Kindle Paperwhite) shows a little \"Footnotes\" popup window instead of navigating to the glossary.  This is great, except for the fact that it says \"Footnote\", whereas it should say \"Glossary\", but this seems to be a Kindle software default--any hints on how to change this would be awesome.)</em></p>\n\n<h2>Modify Built-In Software</h2>\n\n<p>If there is any way to let the software know (iBooks / Kindle App / other software) that the book has a custom glossary, so that the default behavior is modified, this would be ideal.  In other words, when you long-press the word, you don't just get the default popover (as in the Kindle software or iBooks) but you also get some way to look at the glossary definition.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I know of no way that this can be done, but I'm asking in case anyone knows.</p>\n\n<h2>Javascript</h2>\n\n<p>Javascript is theoretically supported in EPUB 3, but in reality, out of the major eReading options, iBooks has support, and possibly Kobo (haven't looked into it) but nothing else does.  Certainly not the rather antiquated MOBI format, and the KF8 format officially does not support JS.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind using JS would be to create a custom popover, whenever you tap or long-press a word that has a glossary entry.  The custom popover would ideally allow you to choose between the built-in dictionary and the glossary entry.  (See <a href=\"http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2010/06/24/javascript-and-interactivity-in-ibooks/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this example</a> to get an idea.)</p>\n\n<p>It seems like this would be feasible only in iBooks, and perhaps Kobo, to show the glossary entries.  (The popover would just have the hyperlink in it, basically.)  In iBooks, I'm not sure how I would activate the built-in dictionary from my own custom JS popover, because the default popover you get in iBooks is the iBooks app's own hook into the text, based on your long-press.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this obviously doesn't have cross-platform support into the Kindle family, but I'm throwing it out there as an option.</p>\n\n<h2>In Summary</h2>\n\n<p>In summary, I'm looking for a way to allow a reader easy access to a glossary in an otherwise standard eBook file (EPUB, Kindle family) across a wide range of eReading options.  The eBook will be purchased in a normal eBook store and downloaded through normal methods.  An App is not a solution, because of their limited distribution capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Any potential way of solving this puzzle is welcome!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Wish I had 150 rep so I could make the tags \"glossary\" and \"dictionary\" -_-</p>\n",

    "body": "<h2>Brackets.io</h2>\n\n<p>As a suggestion, I have been enjoying using <a href=\"http://brackets.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brackets</a> to create epubs on my Mac.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z1snh.png\" alt=\"Brackets.io Screenshot\"></p>\n\n<h2>Procedure</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Unarchive your epub into a folder (change the extension to <code>.zip</code>, and extract).</li>\n<li>Open Brackets, and go to File -> Open Folder.  Select your extracted epub folder.</li>\n<li>Edit any of your HTML and CSS files!</li>\n<li>Activate Live Preview to view the ebook in Chrome!  The preview will change as you type.  (Not totally accurate rendering, compared to how it'll look on an eReader, but suitable.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why do this?  Because Brackets has some pretty neat features.  For example, if you're going through your HTML and you decide you want to change the style on something, just highlight the tag or the class attribute and activate Quick Edit (Cmd+E on OSX) and you can immediately edit the CSS styles, even if it's in a different file!  Super convenient.</p>\n\n<h2>Caveat</h2>\n\n<p>One note: if you open the <code>.opf</code> or <code>.ncx</code> files, you will notice that there is no syntax highlighting.  To fix this, as <a href=\"https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Language-Support#preferences\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">covered here</a>, go to Debug -> Open Preferences File and add these as XML types within the JSON structure.  For example, here is my preferences file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    \"useTabChar\": false,\n    \"tabSize\": 4,\n    \"spaceUnits\": 4,\n    \"closeBrackets\": false,\n    \"showLineNumbers\": true,\n    \"styleActiveLine\": true,\n    \"wordWrap\": true,\n    \"linting.enabled\": true,\n    \"linting.collapsed\": false,\n    \"quickview.enabled\": true,\n    \"debug.showErrorsInStatusBar\": false,\n    \"language.fileExtensions\":{\n        \"opf\": \"xml\",\n        \"ncx\": \"xml\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Version Control</h2>\n\n<p>Being a programmer at heart, version control is appealing to me, even when dealing with ebooks!  I use <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Git</a> for that.  The thing with applying version control to an epub file is that an epub is a binary zip archive, so Git would not be able to differentiate between changes to the files if you edit the epub with something like Sigil.</p>\n\n<p>When you're working with the epub exploded, using Brackets, you can use Git to apply version control to what you're doing.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why do I make this point?  Well, mostly to point out that there's a silver lining to the fact that you have to work with the epub exploded if you want to use Brackets.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Generating EPUBs</h2>\n\n<p><em>Edited with new method!</em></p>\n\n<p>When I want to generate an epub file out of my folder structure, I use a simple Applescript file (remember I'm on OSX) that I found to do this.  The essence of the process is creating a zip archive out of the folder and then changing the extension to \"epub\", but there are some <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=58913\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">potential issues</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There's an article called <a href=\"http://indesignsecrets.com/unzip-and-zip-epub-files-safely-with-these-applescripts.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unzip and Zip EPUB files safely with these AppleScripts</a>, which links to a <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55681&amp;page=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MobileRead thread</a>, in which a fellow named Dan Rodney gives the scripts.  Here is a <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=60233&amp;d=1288118871\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">direct link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I stuck the creation script in my Finder toolbar for easy access, and I changed the icon (<a href=\"https://superuser.com/a/37813/339646\">detailed here</a>) to an epub logo (with transparent background) that I found on Google Images.  So I just highlight the folder in Finder, click the button, and I have an epub!</p>\n\n<h2>Validation</h2>\n\n<p><em>Bonus section!  Nothing to do with a WYSIWYG editor per se, but validation is important if you're going to be hacking around and editing your epub file by hand!</em></p>\n\n<p>In terms of validation, <a href=\"https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EpubCheck</a> is one of the industry standards, and I would suggest using one of the GUI incarnations.  The <a href=\"http://www.pagina-online.de/produkte/epub-checker/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pagina version</a> works great for me; stick it in the OSX dock and just drag epubs onto it to get a report.</p>\n\n<h2>Fin.</h2>\n",

    "body": "<p>This is what I've found thus far.</p>\n\n<h2>Cross-Platform</h2>\n\n<p>The most cross-platform solution to providing an accessible glossary would be using hyperlinks (styled so as to be somewhat unobtrusive) that link to a glossary in the back.  Only the first occurrence of a word would be hyperlinked in this way, and the glossary entries would contain links that send the reader back to that occurrence of the word.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pros: Cross-platform compatibility. EPUB 2 compliant.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Cons: Only the first word can be linked. Glossary terms must be styled to be different from the rest of the text, which could be distracting.</em></p>\n\n<h2>iBooks</h2>\n\n<p>iBooks supports Javascript, so you could build a homebrew JS solution.  I haven't fully explored this yet.</p>\n\n<p>iBooks also touts support for EPUB 3.  The EPUB 3 specification includes a bunch of new markup, including special attributes that define hyperlinks as \"footnote\" or \"endnote\" hyperlinks, specifically the <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/accessibility/guidelines/content/semantics/epub-type.php\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>epub:type</code></a> attribute.</p>\n\n<p>When you make footnote/glossary hyperlinks, and use the special <code>epub:type</code> attributes, iBooks will create a popover to display your content, rather than navigating to it, which is spiffy!</p>\n\n<p>Details and examples on how to use this are given by Liz Castro on <a href=\"http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2012/05/creating-pop-up-footnotes-in-epub-3-and.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">her blog</a>, but the overall implementation would be similar to the cross-platform method.  The main difference is that your glossary entries would go at the bottom of the chapter instead of in the back of the book (<a href=\"http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2012/05/creating-pop-up-footnotes-in-epub-3-and.html?showComment=1403276367007#c8986249974770424737\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently</a> iBooks doesn't support this if your link target is outside of the current HTML document).  You may or may not have to CSS the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tags to be hidden, as well.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pros: You can show the glossary entry for every occurrence of the word, because you are not navigating (and therefore don't require backlinks). It's also just cooler than the cross-platform method.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Cons: Only supported by iBooks.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Kindle</h2>\n\n<p>One way to have a custom glossary on the Kindle would be to create a separate ebook file, in a dictionary format, and provide it for free on the Kindle Store.  In the front of the book, provide a link to that item so that your reader can download it to their Kindle or Kindle App.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note that I'm not familiar with the dictionary format that's used in Kindle, or how you would create one.</em></p>\n\n<p>Then, the reader would have to set that dictionary as their active one while reading.  Any time they clear a word (using the standard long-press gesture), it will show the glossary definition, if there is one.</p>\n\n<p>The exact behavior varies slightly between the Kindle devices and the Kindle App:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On a Kindle, when you look up a word and it's not in your \"active\" dictionary, it will attempt to show a definition from your \"default\" dictionary. <em>(Tested on Kindle Paperwhite 2.)</em></li>\n<li>In the Kindle iOS App, when you look up a word and it's not in your \"active\" dictionary, it shows \"no definition found\", and the user will have to switch to another dictionary. <em>(Tested on iOS 7 with latest Kindle App version.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One issue with this is if your glossary contains <em>phrases</em>, and not just single-word terms.  The long-press feature of the Kindle works by highlighting the word that your finger is on, and showing the definition for that word.  Therefore if your glossary had the phrase \"mad as a hatter\", and your reader long-presses \"mad\", they would not find your custom definition.  A potential workaround for this would be to index any phrases in your glossary by the first word in that phrase, so \"mad as a hatter\" is indexed under \"mad\".  I'm not 100% sure if this is possible yet, but I will probably be looking into it soon.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pros: The normal method of looking up definitions can show your glossary definitions.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Cons: Requires that the user download a second book to gain access to the glossary. May require that the user switches between dictionaries. Only works on the Kindle family. Not every Kindle device has been tested.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Nook</h2>\n\n<p>Unexplored.</p>\n\n<h2>Kobo</h2>\n\n<p>Unexplored.</p>\n\n<h2>Other</h2>\n\n<p>Unexplored.</p>\n\n<h2>Fin.</h2>\n",

Quark and InDesign are two commercial top notch desktop publishing software that have both (finally) integrated EPUB exporting into their software because of the rise of popularity in ebooks.  However, this is an extension of their original application which is simply meant for static layouts.  A good way of thinking about an ebook is to think of it as a simple locally stored website.  It can do most of the things that a website can do, just like you see websites with videos in them, so can an ebook have them.  And like a website, ebooks are written in HTML (XHTML if you want to be specific) CSS, Java, with support for images, videos, etc.  All HTML CSS and JS are at the end of the day is plain text with tags.  You can learn more about these languages at places like codeacademy.  Thus, all Indesign and Quark do is automate the writing of this code by trying to assume what you meant from the static layout of your earlier design before export. </p>\n\n<p>If you get notepad+ (free) and have the ability to unzip and zip an epub into its constituent  parts then you can literally write all the code out by following the EPUB 3 specifications.  Your best bet however, is probably something like pressbooks <a href=\"http://pressbooks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pressbooks.com/</a>, which allow you to lay out the design of your ebook much like you would in Indesign and Quark and which you can export into an epub for very little money - esp. when compared with Adobe products.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this makes sense, I tried to unpack a bunch in a little bit of space based on what I assumed was your knowledge level. </p>\n",

That's why I was thinking of buying an ebook reader. However I have some requirements and with so many devices on the market it's hard to find out (and decide) which one is suited for me.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly read books in English. I can read them without a dictionary, but an English-English (or even English-Polish) dictionary is a plus.</p>\n\n<p>Lately I also started to read Japanese webnovels and I it would be great if I could read them on this device (so it needs to have Japanese characters support).</p>\n\n<p>My Japanese is still a bit lacking and I do need a dictionary for reading those novels, but thanks to tools such as <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rikaichan</a> and <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rikaikun</a> I can quickly look up the words I don't understand when I read them on my PC in a web browser. That's why I'd like the device to have a similar Japanese-English dictionary if possible. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the browser tool, you point the cursor at the first character of the word you don't understand, it than guesses the whole word (and also gives 5 alternative words) and provides translation for those. Assuming an ebook reader with similar working Japanese-English dictionary exists, it would probably be easier to use if the device has a touchscreen.</p>\n\n<p>Japanese web novles are available for free on the internet and can even be downloaded. This said I have to convert them to EPUB myself, so it would be great if the device could allow me to load my own files and support EPUB format (I'd need that for most of my English books too, so this feature is rather mandatory).</p>\n\n<p>I tried to find out if Kindle Paperwhite would do the job, but from what I understood, only the Japanese version has a Japanese dictionary (and a Japanese-Japanese one at that). I couldn't find out if the dictionary is smart enough to detect words and if it can deal with inflection.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I did some research and I found out that there is <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00AKIUDAY\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> Japanese-English dictionary for Kindle Paperwhite. However I'm not sure if I'll be able to buy it from Amazon.com if I live in Poland (and I'm not sure how to check that). If I will be able to buy this in my country, then I might consider buying Kindle Paperwhite. Too bad there is no legit way to buy Japanese novels if you don't live in Japan (registering on Amazon.jp with fake personal information doesn't sound very legitimate to me).</p>\n",

The one that is closest to my requirements is Kindle Paprwhite (if I install additional dictionary which I would have to buy, but which might be unavailable in my country), but unfortunately it doesn't support EPUB file (I would have to convert them to MOBI). The reason why most of the devices wont do what I want is because they run on a closed OS. This made me wonder why there are not ebook readers that run Android and...</p>\n\n<p>I read the comment from Tom which put me on right track. Rather than google for ebook readers that do all that I want (which gives poor results), why not google for a E ink Android tablets. I did that right away and I found those two devices: Onyx Boox M96, Onyx Boox T68.</p>\n\n<p>At first I was considering buying Onyx Boox M96, since the display is bigger. However lack of touchscreen (you have to use stylus) and high price turned me off. I'm probably going to buy the smaller Onyx Boox T68 (despite the higher resolution, the smaller screen will probably make reading comic books slightly annoying).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zyz.mobile&amp;hl=pl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jade Reader</a> does exactly what I want in terms of Japanese text and it's actually compatible with the Onyx Boox T68. The app could use some improvements (splitting text into pages, the dictionary popup should take into account the position of selected text, now it can shows up always on the bottom of the screen and appear on top of the text you were reading).</p>\n",

I can't install FBReader on it. The device comes with FBReader preinstalled (among other software<sup>1</sup>), but it's buggy and crashes on my homemade epub files (I had no problems with those in FBReader on my cell phone and on a cheap tablet that had very similar specs and same OS as Onyx Boox T68). The preinstalled dictionary takes the whole screen and is a little bit slow, so I would much prefer to be able to use ColorDict, however preinstalled FBReader (and it appears all of the preinstalled readers) is incompatible with ColorDict.</p>\n\n<p>For a second I thought I can install regular FBReader on the device, but because there is already a version of FBReader installed, I can't do that. I can't uninstall any of the preinstalled apps either. The only way for me to uninstall those would be to root the device, but I don't want to do that because I'll lose the warranty.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to rename and compile FBReader myself, but after spending 4 evenings on the problem I give up (finally I managed to build FBReader, but I wasn't able to rename the package for some reason).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. There is OnyxReader, OReader, FBReader and Cool Reader. Of the 3 OReader appears to be the fastest and most stable (actually I haven't encountered any problems yet), but it isn't compatible with ColorDict (at least the preinstalled version isn't) and internal anchors don't appear to work.</sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After a lot of trial and error I finally managed to rename and compile FBReader. While it has some minor issues of it's own (doesn't refresh eink screen, doesn't hide the non-standard top android bar, when zoomed chapter headers end up being too big in compare to regular text, no physical page turning button support) it's much more stable and does everything I required perfectly xD</p>\n\n<p>And yes, ColorDict also works the way it should. Unlike in Moon+ where the dictionary popup took half of the screen for some reason, in FBReader it takes a small part of the screen and never ends up covering the selected text.</p>\n\n<p>This said, other recommendations are welcome. Even if they don't help me out directly, they might help others with the same problem as I had.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>First, a note: I will not be considering PDFs in this answer, because I do not consider PDFs to be ebooks. There are a number of reasons for this, like lack of reflowability and end-user customization options, but the primary reason is that PDFs are not generally sold at sites that sell ebooks--you can't sell your PDFs through iBooks or the Kindle store or whatnot. Others have other opinions, and that's fine&mdash;the relevant info is that I won't be considering PDFs here.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of variety of devices supporting the format, epub is the clear standard&mdash;it's supported on nearly everything that reads ebooks. When you look at numbers, though, it's a different story: according to <a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/bisg-report-a-few-more-ebook-stats/\">an article</a> at Digital Book World, a recent Book Industry Study Group found the following statistics to the question \"Where do you typically acquire ebooks?\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>Amazon.com website: 51.3%\nAmazon App: 15.7%\niBooks/iTunes (Apple): 8.2%\nBarnes &amp; Noble App: 6.1%\nBarnes &amp; Noble website: 5.7%\nAll other sources: 12.8%\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This means that Amazon accounts for roughly 2/3 of the sales of ebooks, making their proprietary mobi/KF8 format the dominant format.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, there is no \"winner\" yet, and there is not likely to be any time soon. Apple, Google, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Kobo are enough to ensure that epub will remain alive and kicking for quite some time. With a majority of the sales, Amazon has no impetus to switch to a standard, and they don't appear to be in any danger of losing much market share. Where we are is where we're likely to be for quite a while, which means making two formats: epub and mobi/KF8. fortunately, Amazon has gotten much better at making tools that convert from epub to their format, so concentrating on epub will give you something for Amazon as well with little extra work.</p>\n",

The\n  display is  reflective, which means you can read it clearly even in\n  bright sunlight. Electronic paper uses  ink just like books and\n  newspapers, but it displays the ink particles electronically.</p>\n  \n  <p>On occasion, your screen may seem to flash. This is part of the\n  process of updating the  e-reader display. By default, your Kindle\n  features fast, smooth page turns, minimizing the  number of flashes.\n  To refresh the page with every page turn, from the Home screen tap the\n  Menu button and select Settings. Tap Reading Options and use the Page\n  Refresh setting to  set your preference. For manga refresh settings,\n  tap the Menu button when reading a manga  book and select the Page\n  Refresh On/Off setting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I guess it's common for all devices.

As others have noticed, the Kindle Cloud Reader and PC/Mac-based readers don't support Personal Documents fully (I believe the Cloud Reader doesn't support them at all; the native apps, last I knew, allowed you to sideload documents but don't synchronize them, but it's been a while since I tried); so I thought that since I have some Android virtual machines (using <a href=\"https://www.genymotion.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genymotion</a>) I might as well install the Android Kindle app there.</p>\n\n<p>I was able to do that, and when I go to Amazon's Manage My Content and Devices page I can see the new device, but I can't seem to find a way to assign that device an Amazon email like my other, physical, devices. I also never see the Personal Documents in its list of books the way I do on my phone and tablet.</p>\n\n<p>It used to be the case (around October 2014) that when I ran the Kindle app in the emulator, it displayed a progress spinner and \"Checking for new items &amp; syncing…\" for an indefinite amount of time (I remember leaving it spinning for over an hour); now that doesn't happen, but still my Personal Documents didn't show up. In addition, if I reboot the virtual machine, the app asks me for my login information as if I had never run it on the device before.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So my main question is:</strong> how can I make the Kindle app in an emulator work just like on a physical device? <strong>Secondarily,</strong> I'm wondering whether the Kindle app somehow detect it's running in an emulator, and refuses to allow full access for that reason -- and if so, how; or is this some sort of subtle bug in the interaction between emulation and app?</p>\n",

This has been a battleground in the ebook world for a while now but we are starting to get more support for the publisher side CSS because fundamentally you can't have 'one CSS to rule them all (ebooks)'  Sure, at first it looks flashy and nice like you mention above but once you start importing a variety of books with different formatting needs you begin to see the limitations of this generic CSS almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Also appending !important to your CSS properties and attibutes can sometimes work as a last ditch effort to overriding the device / application CSS - check out how to implement it here:<a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/</a></p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps :)</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I found my answer. Several things were being done incorrectly.</p>\n\n<p>First, ScribeNet's conversion process likes to close non-linking anchor tags with a <code>/&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>. E-books read this with no problem, but the basic HTML gets squirrely and starts thinking there has been an interruption in the numbering of the list. Thus, any page breaks that occurred in my original print book and that were marked up in my HTML needed to be closed properly with <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>From there it was just a simple matter of setting <code>&lt;p class=\"nlf\"&gt;</code> (or nl or nll where nlf represents \"numbered list first\", nl is \"numbered list\", and nll is \"numbered list last\") to have the appropriate margins and text indents in CSS (which you can sort out for yourself based on what format you'd like). But the clincher was to use:</p>\n\n<p><code>display: list-item; list-style: decimal</code> in my CSS for these 3 class elements. What this does is display a paragraph as if it were a list element, and then look to the list-style to determine how the list is marked, which is in this case with cardinal numbers followed by a period/full-stop.</p>\n\n<p>You can mess around with various list styles such as <code>disc</code>, <code>decimal</code>, <code>lower-roman', etc. But there are also two modifiers,</code>inside<code>and</code>outside`. You can call them like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>list-style: lower-latin inside</code></p>\n\n<p>What this will do is go through the Latin alphabet in cardinal order from a to z for each subsequent paragraph in the list, and then rather than inserting a large whitespace (equivalent to a 'tab') between the period/full-stop after the Latin letter and the start of the content of the paragraph, it will instead indent the list-marker and tuck it in closer to the text. This is nice if you are producing, for example, multiple-choice questions at the end of a chapter/unit of a text book. Very handy!</p>\n",

The CSS support for modern browsers is much much more extensive than the CSS support for e-readers.  There simply has not been the same level (or expectation) of standardization for the epub format, in general.

    "body": "<p>The light used on Kindles is amazing since the light is projected down toward the screen rather than up in your eyes.  Amazon developed this technology and patented it (hopefully it will be sold to computer monitor makers one day), and it's basically equivalent to pointing a light bulb away from you rather than in your eyes.  This technology helps reduce eye strain (that burning feeling you may get if you stare at a screen for awhile), but it will still happen.  </p>\n\n<p>The Voyage has the same light technology as the paperwhite, however, they have added a sensor to adjust the amount of light projected based on the conditions of light around you.  This seems like a gimmick, but so far seems to be a great feature as most people don't change the light often, but when it's automatically done, it helps greatly, and allows for an even greater amount of time before you have eye strain.  The Voyage so far seems to be great, although there does appear to be a flaw in some of the screens (uneven yellowing of the page-you'll find lots of info from google), and of course there is a bit of a sticker shock associated with it.  Also, if you want a solution immediately, you'll have to wait with the Voyage as there is presently about a month wait if you order it today (11/4/14).</p>\n\n<p>In regards to storage, if you're not putting mp3s on the kindle (something you would only do with the audio version of the kindle), then you should be fine.  I have over 600 books on my kindle with about 1/3 of the space left.  I notice that autobiography and non-fiction titles tend to take up more than fiction, so you may want to keep that in mind, but storage doesn't seem to be a ceiling that the average user, or even super user, hits.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to your model and dictionary pronunciation, it's not possible.  The only way around it is to temporarily turn audio on, have it read that part of the book, then turn it back off.  The audio feature of a dictionary is incredibly amazing and important, but for some reason they didn't include that support in the kindle model you have (I had the same model).  I keep my phone near me when I read and use the dictionary.com app for pronunciation, hardly ideal, but it works.</p>\n\n<p>As for light alternatives, I personally tried several clip-on book lights (name brands and cheap knock offs) and did not like any of them.  They added weight, got in the way, fell off easily, produced uneven light on the screen, and overall just made reading on the kindle clumsy and awkward.  I ended up buying a new bedside light as I was never able to find a nice mobile solution (until the voyage!).</p>\n",

First and foremost is the book cover, especially those that have images that are sexually suggestive or include varying degrees of nudity. How much is too much seems to vary, but anything that might make a school librarian question the content is likely to raise the attention of the Amazon censors as well.</p>\n\n<p>The next most common red flag is the title of the book. Apparently, anything that specifically suggests an incestuous relationship, especially with a blood relative, is pretty much guaranteed to get your book flagged. Some authors have gotten away with pseudo-incest (step-dad, uncle, etc.), but even those are starting to get flagged more frequently. </p>\n\n<p>A more recent development has been with titles that suggest sex with monsters or other creatures. Apparently some people have complained that such books are nothing more than bestiality, and that has caused Amazon to start scrutinizing them much more closely. This appears to be true in regards to the actual content as well, and not just the title on the front of the book. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I would suggest looking at the book's reviews to see if anyone has complained about anything specific in the book. I know a couple of authors who have found their books to be labeled as \"adult\" because a reviewer found the content to be questionable and complained quite a bit in the review. Amazon seems to be jumping on such reviews pretty aggressively, and often without actually investigating to see if the comments in the review are actually true. </p>\n",

This can range from 6% for a new author to as much as 20% for a developed author. Alternatively, these authors usually also receive a guaranteed advance on their sales, so even if the book is a bust, they will have something to show for it. In spite of this, more and more authors are beginning to reclaim the rights to their back titles and sef-publish them because they have better potential there.</p>\n\n<p>If you truly want to help an author, the best thing you can do is leave a review on whatever site you purchased the book from.

Telling others about the book will also often help in generating additional sales, and those are always welcome!</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Please note that if you simply need to transfer <code>.epub</code> files to the reader, you can simply connect it to your computer with an USB cable, it will be treated like an external USB storage drive; you can simply copy your books on the reader (maybe on a new sub-directory to keep things clean and neat) and when you disconnect it, it will update the database and recognize your new books. There isn't anything easier than this ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway for a more complete management, I suggest you to try <a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\">Calibre</a>, it is a superb ebook manager itself with a ton of <a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/about\">features</a>; also, it is free and opensource and it is available for Linux systems too, if these are things that are relevant for you.</p>\n\n<p>One of its strengths is the opportunity to add plugins to extend its functionalities. It works perfectly with any ereader device, without the need to add anything, but I suggest to you a couple of plugins that are specifically aimed at Kobo users, that can be useful to have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=211135\">Kobo Touch Extended Driver</a>: It replaces the standard Kobo device driver shipped with Calibre, its main feature is to optimize the <code>.epub</code> books you are sending to the device with the particular format used by Kobo, called <code>.kepub.epub</code>. Kobo e-readers have two different readers inside (I mean \"reader\" as a software here), one is used for standard ePub files while the other has some different features and is used for Kepubs. I prefer the last one, but in the end it is a matter of personal preferences, so I suggest you to try both of them and see which format you like the most.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=215339\">Kobo Utilities</a>: this is a must-have tool, IMHO. It allow you to perform many operations directly on the device, by manipulating its internal database; it is nothing too complicate, but it could be considered as a tool for advanced users that know what they are doing; I must say that I've never had any kind of problem, but I suggest you to read the warnings from the author. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please note that you don't have to download these plugins from the MobileRead forum, the easiest way is to install them directly from inside Calibre, where this task can be performed from a nice and handy graphical interface.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I think some of the larger photo licensing services charge a lot of money for book publishing -- they lump print and ebook together. It's in your best interest to be flexible about which exact photos you need and not have your heart set on a single photograph. There's lots of great photography out there waiting to be discovered which can be had for a dime. </p>\n\n<p>Creative commons photos can be an option, but you need to establish proof that the CC license has been labeled properly. For CC photos I sometimes will still offer a payment  to the rights holder to establish good relations and to make them aware of what's going on. </p>\n\n<p>Be prepared for the fact that some rights holder might simply not wish to grant a right to you no matter what you offer. </p>\n\n<p>If you are contacting a rights holder and they are not a big service, you should send a friendly email and name your price up front. Ask for some high quality photo -- the ebook vendors have now been able to accommodate higher resolution photos.</p>\n\n<p>Finally if you want a relatively safe place to find historical photos, check out wikipedia and wikimedia. Their process for vetting photos and giving them the right license is pretty reliable. </p>\n\n<p>Due diligence is the important word here. If you're using CC or public domain photos, you might want to make screenshots with dates of access  to use as evidence that you had every reason to believe that the copyright label was accurate. I believe Flickr has a tool to verify the license at a certain date. </p>\n\n<p>The good news though is that unless you have a runaway bestseller on your hands, rights disputes after publishing can usually be handled simply by swapping out the image for future editions. But obviously it's better to clear everything  beforehand. </p>\n\n<p>You ask for prices. I can only speak for myself when trying to contract freelance photographers who have individual websites. I generally do low cost publishing. </p>\n\n<p>I usually offer minimum of $20 for a CC photo   and actually recently it's been $40 because the $20 was mainly for noncommercial web publishing. If you need other rights (like commercial use or exclusive), expect the price to be higher. I would be willing to pay $50-100 for a high resolution photo, and I know the commercial services can be included to charge 200-1000$ if you're ordering through them. </p>\n\n<p>Indie photographers are willing to entertain offers that are below the rates of \nGetty, etc, but you need to send a short email with a dollar amount and intended use. The offer can be low but not too low it is insulting. I think it's fair to state your professional status... Photographers might cut you a break if you convince them you're starting out or dealing with a very small project.  And you should be willing to pay the money immediately. </p>\n\n<p>The advantage over stock photography outfits is price; the disadvantage is that photographers can be quirky and may sometimes feel that you're trying to take advantage of them, so you need to respect their interests.  Be liberal about giving credit -- perhaps linking to the website.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>From another website: \nRights Managed – With this license you only pay for what you’re using the image for. Rights managed licenses define exact use in terms of where, when and for how long an image is being used.</p>\n\n<p>Royalty Free – This is the most flexible option and the most straight forward. You pay a one–off fee to use the image with no restrictions on how you use image, how many times you use it or how long you use it for. You can use the image across multiple projects, forever. There are some restrictions on image use for * reselling’.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure Royalty Free photos are less of a PITA to deal with, but Rights Managed photos might save you a bit of money. Unfortunately they're structured more around commercial print publishing, and they estimate price by circulation and number of copies. But with ebooks, you can't give that kind of estimate.....Hence the difficulty. </p>\n\n<p>Finally you might enjoy this horror story about what happens when you don't clear photo rights on a photo: <a href=\"http://blog.webcopyplus.com/2011/02/14/legal-lesson-learned-copywriter-pays-4000-for-10-photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.webcopyplus.com/2011/02/14/legal-lesson-learned-copywriter-pays-4000-for-10-photo/</a></p>\n",

    "body": "<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:<br>\nThe problem is definitely with Adobe. They have this thing called DRM (Digital Rights Management), that's essentially a layer of protection that's supposed to minimize the amount of book piracy. Essentially, when you buy a book with DRM (as opposed to DRM-free), you are not downloading a .PDF or .EPUB file, you are getting a .ACSM, which is Adobe's file format for license + book. So if you open that .ACSM file with an Adobe-supported app (such as ADE), it can figure out whether the license is valid or not - in other words whether you've purchased the book yourself or if you've just downloaded it from the Internet - and if it is, let you read it.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is, obviously, a situation like yours, where you simply want to read the book on a device that doesn't know how to handle .ACSM files. Unfortunately, there is no \"proper\" way to do this, you need to get rid of this license Adobe attached to your book and work with an actual real DRM-free PDF. If you google something like \".acsm to pdf\" or \"remove DRM from .acsm file\" you should be able to find plenty of tools online. I'll link to just one of them - but keep in mind, I haven't tested it myself. <a href=\"http://www.epubor.com/how-to-convert-acsm-to-pdf-free.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.epubor.com/how-to-convert-acsm-to-pdf-free.html</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Take a look around either My Documents or your AppData. You can find the latter by pressing {Windows Key}+R to bring up the Run window, and then typing %AppData%. This will probably send you to C:\\Users{username}\\AppData\\Roaming, but if you can't find a folder called Kobo Desktop or something similar, you may need to step up from Roaming and take a look at Local.</p>\n\n<p>This being said, from what I could gather online, it may be damn near impossible to do what you want to do without stripping the books off their DRM.</p>\n",

There are some specific exceptions in place, like <i>parody</i> (which is about creating transformative work from pre-existing ones) and <i>fair use</i>, which has <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">four main considerations</a>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is\nof commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes</li>\n<li>The nature of the copyrighted work</li>\n<li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the\ncopyrighted work as a whole</li>\n<li>The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of,\nthe copyrighted work</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The important thing to note here is that you can't just say \"no look, I'm not going to diminish your market or the value of your work, so it's totally fair use\". Well, you can, but it'll be up to the courts to decide who is right, which means be prepared for some long, drawn-out legal battles. The best advice is to ask permission if a work is not clearly licensed by the original creator, and if it is clearly licensed (again, by the original creator, not just some random person on the internet), to abide by the strictures laid out in the license.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>To focus, please assume I care only about one thing: The experience of reading \"side loaded,\" scanned PDF files of books downloaded off the Internet on a portable device.  There is an upper bound of around 200MB for a single file.</p>\n\n<p>I am not interested in \"native\" PDF files (re-flowable), EPUB, or any other e-book format.  I am not interested in reformatting the PDF files, optimizing, ORC-ing, etc.  Not interested in e-book marketplaces or dictionaries or apps or note-taking or games or other bells and whistles.  Here's the workflow: I search Google for an old book, find it on archive.org, download it, copy/sync it to the device, read, rinse, repeat.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of reviews of devices that cover reading different e-book formats, but rarely do they cover reading scanned PDF books.  If mentioned in a review, the topic usually gets a sentence or two, and that's it.  Or it only talks about \"native\" PDF support.  Or the review is from 2011 and out-dated.</p>\n\n<p>I have for months been trying to get an answer to this, and this is what I've found so far as my options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An e-reader with e-ink</li>\n<li>An Android tablet (or other vendor) with a decent display</li>\n<li>An e-ink Android tablet</li>\n<li>Sony Digital Paper</li>\n<li>Laptop computer (I already have one, I'm looking for a better experience)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>E-ink would be best, because these books are all scanned black-and-white.  I work all day on the computer, the last thing my eye balls need is for me to stare at another lit screen into the wee hours of the night.  But most e-reader reviews that I've read said they just don't handle navigating scanned PDF files well (if they can even open them).  Is that still true?  Besides software support and ease of use (which is probably the biggest issue), the amount of RAM and processor power is likely a concern, too.</p>\n\n<p>A tablet would work if it had a good, crisp display.  But the big concern here is eye strain.  At least a decent tablet will have enough RAM and processor power to handle a large PDF and allow me to navigate it.  So this is a workable option.  I have actually read a large scanned PDF book on a first generation iPad -- the PDF app kept crashing and the display was poor and pixel-y, but I persevered.  Still, my eyes hated me.</p>\n\n<p>A hybrid would be the Onyx Boox which appears to be an Android tablet that uses an e-ink display.  This might work.  Reviews suggest it isn't a perfect device but still works well for PDF files.  But I can't tell if the reviewers are talking about scanned PDF files or \"native\" again.  Anyone have experience with this one?</p>\n\n<p>Sony Digital Paper.  I was going to say that cost doesn't matter, but at $1000 I have to set a limit and this is just too much.  This thing apparently will have no problem loading and displaying and navigating any PDF, so this would definitely be an option, except for the prohibitive price.  Has anyone used one of these?  Is this a good device if one intends to use it to read exclusively and not do any note-taking?  Hmm, my wife would kill me.</p>\n\n<p>Getting PDFs on it matters: USB or syncing would be best.  I use Linux exclusively and don't have access to Windows or Mac OS X, so this has to be possible via Linux (e.g., Dropbox support is good on Linux).  But I'm still more concerned with how well the thing supports actually opening and navigating the scanned books.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the question: What devices support reading scanned PDF documents well?  I want to be able to turn the page without waiting 30 seconds.  I want to view a page and scroll around (if need be) without fiddling too much with zooming and waiting too long for rendering.  And likely there are important factors I'm not considering.  Please give me the lowdown.  If the market still isn't prepared to support this use case, that's fine, too, I suppose.  Thanks for your help.</p>\n",

The content.opf and both toc files have specific requirements for the content, as they're epub-required navigational files. The other XHTML files must be valid, but otherwise are more flexible in terms of content. The content of those template files could look like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;link href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;body&gt;\n\n &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The navigational files would have to have the information about the other files added to them each time, but that is fairly automateable with a minimum amount of scripting in a language like Ruby or Python.</p>\n\n<p>In your CSS file, you could have default styles already built for the things you use all the time.

What was the challenge in designing this page or template -- and how did you go about solving it? </p>\n\n<p>Best case scenario is definitely putting dummy text inside your template, but this can be time-consuming and impractical. </p>\n\n<p>You don't need to have chapters (it would be unwieldy to do anyway), but a few select screenshots would do the job (and your job opportunity requires an interview, you can definitely show things off on your tablet). </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>In general, you will probably not get good results on most devices when trying to do a two column layout in epub. There is no way of correlating one paragraph to another, which means you will probably run into situations where the page breaks do not work well if at all. In addition, many epub reading systems do not work well with floating text (which is how you would create columns).</p>\n\n<p>If you'd still like to try experimenting  with it, I would suggest breaking the text of each book into paragraphs, interleaving them, and having the text of one book float left while the other floats right. Look out for paragraphs that run off the edge of the page and do not continue on the next page, though, as well as overlapping text at the top of pages.</p>\n\n<p>A quick and dirty example of some code you could get started with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p class=\"english\"&gt;This is the first paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"italian\"&gt;This is the first paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the corresponding CSS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p.english {\nwidth: 45%;\nmargin: 1.25%;\nfloat: left;\n}\np.italian {\nwidth: 45%;\nmargin: 1.25%;\nfloat: right;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As for the initial conversion, you might check out <a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/1183/what-is-the-minimum-required-content-for-a-valid-epub/1184#1184\">this question</a>.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Assuming that you've got a reflowable epub formatted semantically, it should do this automatically. I've seen some conversions that used tables to lay out text rather than simply putting each paragraph in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, and that can have the result you describe. To be any more specific, I'd have to have a look at your code. If you update your post with a relevant section of HTML and CSS, I'd be happy to do so.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: From what you've posted, it looks like all the spaces in the epub have been replaced with non-breaking spaces. These are space characters that do not function as word boundaries, so lines don't break at them. They are represented by <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There may be more going on in the chaos that comes from an auto-generated epub file--for starters, you might check to see if hyphenation is disabled in the CSS.</p>\n\n<p>One thing you might try is opening up this HTML file in Chrome and see if it looks the same as it does in your devices. If it does, hit shift-ctrl-j to open the developer tools, go to the Elements tab, and then select a particular paragraph that runs off the screen. The Dev tools section should show a list of all the styles that are applied, with checkboxes to temporarily turn them off. At that point, is just a matter of experimenting until you find the one that is causing the problem.</p>\n\n<p>If all else fails, the nuclear option is to just remove everything in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag and to delete the contents of your CSS file.</p>\n\n<p>2nd EDIT: The problem is the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tags throughout. If you do a global find and replace and turn them all into spaces, the problem should go away&mdash;it does in the browser, at any rate. The epub reading systems I checked your file on did not have the problem that you mention, so reading systems may vary.</p>\n\n<p>In general: Your file has been autoconverted by or through Microsoft Word. This is a terrible idea. If you need to go through Word, consider going into something better at conversion, like InDesign, or get used to cleaning up the HTML and CSS on your own. There are numerous other design issues throughout the manuscript, not least of which is that all measurements are absolute rather than relative, meaning that it is not possible for readers to change font size. You should also be aware that whatever did the final conversion did not produce a valid epub file, even taking into account that it is epub 2 instead of epub 3.

It's depressing how few people do this.</p>\n\n<p>The best resource for epub:type is the <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strucutral Semantics Vocabulary</a> from the IDPF. In the \"Document Divisions\" section, they detail what these divisions are used for:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>volume:</strong> A component of a collection.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>part:</strong> A major structural division of a piece of writing, typically\n  encapsulating a set of related chapters.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>chapter:</strong> A major structural division of a piece of writing.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>subchapter:</strong> A major sub-division of a chapter.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>division:</strong> A major structural division that may also appear as a\n  substructure of a part (esp. in legislation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Each of these divisions should apply to either a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</p>\n\n<p>For your case of independent tales and poems, I think we can probably rule out <code>sub-chapter</code>, unless some of your tales are long enough that they have sections within them that are distinct enough to warrant new levels of headers. My inclination would be to use <code>chapter</code> for each item, and potentially <code>part</code> if you have relevant content groupings, eg all the tales in one section and all the poems in another. Division seems to be a division that is larger than a chapter but smaller than a part, and volume would be a whole new book. <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, for example, would be three volumes (one for each book), each comprising 2 parts themselves made up of a number of chapters.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that at present, there are few devices that make use of epub:type tags at all, and none that I'm aware of that use the document divisions. Adding in the semantics now means that when a reading system does come out that makes use of this information, you'll already be set though, which is nice.</p>\n",

I had some large text documents that I used for the test. I created a two column table in LibreOffice and pasted the text files into the left and right cells.  They expanded as necessary (16 pages).  I saved as HTML.  It looked OK in IE.  I imported the book to Calibre and ran a conversion to epub using the defaults.  The text on the right did not show up until about page 5 (white space until then).  I don't know why.<br>\nAs an initial demonstration, this may be helpful, but it obviously has issues, including those cited by Tom of paragraph alignment.  A way to address the alignment might be to use multi row tables and keep the related text in the same row, different columns. A row could be as small as a paragraph, or as large as a chapter.  </p>\n\n<p>I also tried creating a two column frame, but that behaved like a newspaper set up, the text that was beyond the bottom of the first page wrapped to the second column, so that's not the way to go.  </p>\n\n<p>I thought about my test a little more and decided the text I used was not suitable.  I tested again using the first 32 sonnets in the Complete Works of Shakespeare that I had as a text file.  I put the same text into both columns, independently.  I proceeded as above.  After conversion it looked pretty good, but not perfect.  The issues I noted were: the left column had about 4 lines of white space at the top, which the right column did not; the columns did not fully match throughout the epub of 41 pages, but were pretty close.  This may actually meet your needs. </p>\n",

The biggest issue is that Amazon won't admit it and if your unit is out of warranty they want to sell you a new one instead of telling you the simple method of doing a factory reset, i.e. adding a DO_FACTORY_RESTORE file to your root directory! This is utter fraud by Amazon and I spent hours on calls to Amazon trying to get my unit fixed/replaced to no avail. The biggest conspiracy is why this simply fix seems to be widely discussed on Chinese and Russian web site but not on any english sites (hence my propencity to add the magic file name in posts on this topic).</p>\n",

(Note: Even if a script is not\n  container-constrained, the Reading System may impose restrictions on\n  modifications (see also the dom-manipulation feature).)</p>\n  \n  <p>› It may place additional limitations on the capabilities provided to\n  scripts during execution (e.g., limiting networking).</p>\n  \n  <p>› It must implement the JavaScript navigator extension object\n  epubReadingSystem defined in Appendix A, JavaScript epubReadingSystem\n  Object .

    "body": "<p>There are two possibilities here, and without seeing more of the book's code, it's not really possible to tell. The first is that this is extra functionality offered by the reading system rather than something built into the epub file itself. As noted by Liz Castro in <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-contentdocs-vocab-association\" rel=\"nofollow\">the spec</a>, this is similar to Apple's example of</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>supporting symantically marked footnotes, and then \"associating specialized behaviors\" as the spec directs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If that's the case, Moon+ and Calibre don't seem to be supporting the epub 3 spec as directly as Apple does, though&mdash;according to the <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Structural Semantics Vocabulary</a> for epub 3, footnotes should be contained in <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tags marked with <code>epub:type=footnote\"</code> and then corresponding <code>epub:type=\"noteref\"</code>s for the superscripted symbols in the body.</p>\n\n<p>The other possibility is that there is some JavaScript in the ebook file that is somehow accessing content in a different file. Since JavaScript is generally constrained by the DOM, though, this doesn't seem likely.</p>\n\n<p>if you'd like to replicate the behavior yourself in an epub 3 file, the relevant code (heavily cribbed from <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs.html#sec-contentdocs-vocab-association\" rel=\"nofollow\">the spec</a>) to try out would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is some body text with a footnote reference. &lt;a class=\"noteref\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"#note1\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n...\n\n&lt;aside class=\"footnote\" epub:type=\"footnote\" id=\"note1\"&gt;1: This is a corresponding note&lt;/aside&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that this behavior is purely optional&mdash;epub 3 has the ability for publishers to tell the reading system what kind of content a particular section is, and it is up to the reading systems to decide what they want to do with that information.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Based on your comment, it sounds like since there is no JavaScript and the book is epub 2.0, there is either something hack-y going on or the reading systems you're using are looking for particular classes and associating special behavior with them. Based on <a href=\"http://empiricalepub.blogspot.com/2012/09/pop-up-footnotes-in-ibooks-with-sigil.htmlhttp://empiricalepub.blogspot.com/2012/09/pop-up-footnotes-in-ibooks-with-sigil.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a>, I'm guessing the former&mdash;it sounds like you can include the correct namespacing in an epub 2 file to allow <code>epub:type</code> to work, and change the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag to a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> with <code>display: none</code> on its CSS to get this to work in iBooks, which Moon+ and Calibre might be copying.</p>\n\n<p>Note that according to that blog post, this gives you a working ebook that fails epubCheck, which means that many retailers will reject it. Making an epub 3 file might be the way to go for you.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>One reason is that formatting a technical book for printing is 10x easier than formatting it for ebook. Often, people are using Adobe Indesign to handle the difficult formatting issues and while there is an epub export function, I'm guessing that it can't handle technical issues across platforms easily. When you print, you need only to worry about how the printed book looks. </p>\n\n<p>Another issue to think about is that some technical books just work better as printed books. Stuff with lots of diagrams, indices, oversized pages. Sometimes programming books are hard to view as ebooks because the lines of code are hard to look at one page at a time while in printed books there is the possibility of having them on back to back pages. I have the wonderful Docbook XSL book by Bob Staynton, and even though the full book is online <a href=\"http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/</a>  I eventually bought a hard copy because I felt more comfortable putting paperclips on key pages and keeping it near my side as a reference. Some references work better in print form for that reason. </p>\n\n<p>One final thought is that because Amazon decided not to sell PDFs and ibooks doesn't do so either, the publisher can't just sell PDFs except from their own stores. It involves setting up an Adobe content server which manages the DRM. That's a lot of unnecessary work. I suspect if Amazon sold PDFs directly or if a company like Scribd became more popular selling PDF, then this argument would disappear because publishers could just reuse the PDF they used for the print copy. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, I used to say only a few years ago that PDF sucked because it wasn't reflowable and the tablet screens were not large enough. Now, fortunately, 10 inch screens and higher are much more common. so that is no longer a minus for using PDFs for reading it as an ebook. </p>\n",

You will obtain the best results by optimizing your image to the highest quality possible within the file size limit before inputting your files into Kindlegen. If the automatic file conversion is unsatisfactory, try optimizing the images before feeding them to Kindlegen.<br>\n3.64. Make sure that input photos are at least 600x800 pixels in size unless you optimize them according to 3.62</p>\n\n<p>The key here is using media queries to differentiate screens with retina display and screens without retina display because they render graphics differently. Also, if you have high enough resolution graphics to begin with, you don't need to worry about them looking like crap in in ibooks with retinal display. (In my case, my original graphics don't meet the minimal requirements listed above, so I am experiencing major problems trying to upconvert everything). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Resources that I found helpful:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Simulating retina display on chrome browser: \n<a href=\"http://www.marksenff.com/front-end/you-already-have-a-retina-screen-emulator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.marksenff.com/front-end/you-already-have-a-retina-screen-emulator/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/</a>\nmedia queries for various android and ipad devices</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mydevice.io/devices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mydevice.io/devices/</a> screen resolutions</p>\n\n<p>media queries specific to ebooks \n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@sandersk/responsive-ebook-design-a-primer-8bba01328219\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/@sandersk/responsive-ebook-design-a-primer-8bba01328219</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stephen.io/mediaqueries/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stephen.io/mediaqueries/</a> apple-specific media queries\nhow to target retina displays. </p>\n\n<p>The key thing from the last link is the apple-specific nonstandard css:</p>\n\n<pre><code> @media only screen \n and (min-device-width : 768px)  and \n(max-device-width : 1024px) and\n (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n&gt; /* STYLES GO HERE */}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(I believe that other browsers have also nonstandard css  for specifying different pixel ratios. But I have no evidence that any of the ebook reading software supports them). </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I ended up writing unique media queries at certain breakpoints. These breakpoints fit my need to make my graphics work. Your own graphics might require different breakpoints/thresholds. Please note that I did not use queries specific to android or ios and I did not need to specify device-pixel-ratio. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>generic styles, for everybody (and for devices which don't detect\nmedia queries) </li>\n<li>phone media queries valid for both portrait and\n    landscape: min-width 320px max-width: 767px</li>\n<li>phone media queries valid only for landscape 768 to 1500 px\nlandscape (because we assume  2 columns, this is basically the same\nas Phone/Portrait)</li>\n<li>Landscape  over 1500px -- when 2 columns, this will look the same as\nportrait 768-1024 </li>\n<li>768-1024 portrait -- this probably comprises about 60-70%   of the\ndevices</li>\n<li>1025-up portrait -- future proofing, just in case</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I probably will have 3 queries for Kindle: one for e-ink, one for Kf8, and one for 10 inch KF8.

I guess you would also need a simple epub where all the notes go to a final end notes chapter. The semantics for all three ebooks seem to be different, so maintaining three separate ebooks seems to be a pretty amount of work. If it were merely a matter of changing CSS between versions, that would be more manageable (although I guess you could make the text for asides hidden via css for non-ibooks epubs). </p>\n\n<p>I suspect that PDF's output from InDesign can be configured to show footnotes on the bottom of printed pages.

The style preference also seems to differ between e.g. science and humanities.</p>\n\n<p>In e-books references can be styled in the same way as in printed books, just with a hyperlink below the short-name (or number) of the reference.</p>\n\n<p>For an IT specialist publication planned to be published as printed book and as e-book, I intended to use the same style of references into the bibliography as I'm used from writing papers in computer science:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As you can see in [foobar93], [fnord95] and [example.com], foo and bar …</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then in the bibliography at the end of the book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[foobar93] Interpretations of Something; Foo, Bar, et al.; 1993; Bla &amp; Co Publishers</p>\n  \n  <p>[fnord95] Why Something is Wrong; Fnord; 1995; Blubble Pub</p>\n  \n  <p>[example.com] Example Website; <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.example.com/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But my publisher was quite unhappy with that style and suggested to use footnotes instead as it would be better for e-books. From my point of view this is just the same, just with smaller hyperlinks to click and more work for the author as he won't have a central bibliography and multiply mentioned references would need to be written multiple times manually:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As you can see in Interpretations of Something¹, Why Something is Wrong² and the Example Website³, foo and bar …</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then usually on the bottom of the same page (science), or at the end of the chapter (humanities):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>¹ Interpretations of Something; Foo, Bar, et al.; 1993; Bla &amp; Co Publishers</p>\n  \n  <p>² Why Something is Wrong; Fnord; 1995; Blubble Pub</p>\n  \n  <p>³ Example Website; <a href=\"http://www.example.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.example.com/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So from my point of view visually bigger tag-like links seem to be better suited for e-books than footnotes in tiny fonts.</p>\n\n<p>If the reference is just a website, a direct link to it (maybe visually marked as external link somehow) would be best for e-books, but is completely unsuitable for printed books.</p>\n\n<h2>The Question</h2>\n\n<p>Should a book which is published in print as well as electronically have the same references style in both types of media?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If so, is there a reference style known to be especially suited for both media?</p></li>\n<li><p>If not, is there a recommendation how to phrase texts so that references <em>always</em> can be rendered in different styles?

It sounds like you want to ensure that each category is read in a specific order, so your next step would be to decide just what that order should be. </p>\n\n<p>If you still want to make use of any tags, then you will want to convert those to html anchor tags, which will also be used for each category (chapter). When all is finished, you could have a full Table of Contents (your list of categories), as well as a directory of tags. This will probably require some additional work in converting the content and getting it formatted properly, but it is definitely doable. </p>\n\n<p>If you decide you would like to tackle this on your own, I strongly recommend using <a href=\"http://guidohenkel.com/2010/12/take-pride-in-your-ebook-formatting/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guido Henkel's guide to formatting</a>. It's a nine-step process that takes you through very detailed instructions on how to create a properly formatted e-book, including how to create a Table of Contents. He will also explain the free tools you will need, such as Notepad++ and Calibre. I used this to create my first e-book four years ago, and it is still the same process I use now, with nearly forty titles published. </p>\n\n<p>This guide can be used by anyone, but it would be a lot easier if you already have a basic understanding of html. It isn't required though, because he does an excellent job of explaining everything and taking you through the process step-by step. If you find this to be too daunting, then your best approach would be to find someone to format it for you.</p>\n",

My guess is that the solution you want is similar to what I am doing. </p>\n\n<p>First, you need to use css media queries. Second, you need to specify the width of the div containing the image.

For HTML code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=image-replace-title&gt;\n&lt;img/&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here would be the CSS code I am using.       </p>\n\n<pre><code>@media only screen \n  and (min-device-width: 320px) \n  and  (max-device-width: 767px) \n  {\n\ndiv.image-replace-title  {\nwidth: 94%;\n  margin-left:  auto;\n   margin-right:  auto;\n}\n\ndiv.image-replace-title img {\nwidth: 100%;\ndisplay: inline;}\n\n    }\n\n        @media only screen \n  and (min-device-width: 768px)\n  and (orientation: portrait)\n\n  {\n    div.image-replace-title  {\n    width: 80%;\n    max-width: 684px;\n      margin-left:  auto;\n       margin-right:  auto;\n    }\n\n    div.image-replace-title img {\n    width: 100%;\n    display: inline;\n        }\n\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the record, the first media query is for iphones, the second one is for ipads 1-4.

In fact, the Kindle app is really the only tool for viewing and syncing purchased content. </p>\n\n<p>For me, any tablet I have contains the Adobe app (or Bluefire app) for storing Adobe DRM stuff, the Kindle app (for storing Kindle DRM stuff) and the Google app (for storing epubs -- encrypted and nonencrypted). </p>\n\n<p>That means you are going to be spreading your content into three different apps. </p>\n\n<p>I don't think there is a way to export your metadata from one library management system into another, especially if you are talking about encrypted stuff. </p>\n\n<p>It's possible to use the same app for encrypted PDF and epub (like the Adobe Digital Editions). But I think it's still better to keep pdfs and epubs on separate apps. </p>\n\n<p>One solution (a not-so-good one) is to keep your metadata on librarything or goodreads. But you'd have to input data manually. I know more about librarything, and know that you can store your inventory spreadsheets which you can sync via Dropbox. But you need to manually generate the spreadsheet each time. </p>\n\n<p>If a solution comes which will bridge the gap between Amazon and the other digital book sellers, I expect that several big publishers would work together to make a central ebook management app which can display titles in each DRM universe and then launch the correct app if you want to open a certain ebook up. But it's unlikely that Amazon would allow personal ebook inventory to be listed by a third party application, if only for privacy reasons. </p>\n\n<p>Until that happens (I think we will be stuck with several apps with their own DRM and syncing mechanism). </p>\n",

They're very expensive, but at least they will format properly for an eink device. </p>\n\n<p>(by the way, both companies have pretty good sales (and occasional free downloads), so I would recommend signing up for their email list. </p>\n\n<p>If you have a Kindle Fire, then all you need to do is to download a PDF reader app (there are many -- don't try to read things  with the Kindle app). </p>\n\n<p>You may be limited by what you can afford, but because PDFs are not reflowable, you want to get a fairly good screen size to read them. You need at least 8 inch screen in my opinion. If you buy smaller, the text size will be hard to read. (There's a zoom function in smaller devices, but it's inconvenient).</p>\n\n<p>Try <a href=\"http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/</a> for a good (and famous) introduction to basic structures (using python as an example). I recommend this for starting out. Here's the pdf of the latest version <a href=\"http://www.ict.ru.ac.za/Resources/cspw/thinkcspy3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ict.ru.ac.za/Resources/cspw/thinkcspy3/</a></p>\n\n<p>(Older editions of this book in other computer languages are here: <a href=\"http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/archive/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/archive/</a> ). </p>\n\n<p>Here's a list of ebooks for free out there \n<a href=\"https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md</a></p>\n\n<p>One more thing. If you have kindle fire, I would sign up for evernote, download the app on your tablet and then clip recent web tutorials on subjects which interest you. this is a good way to read articles when offline; evernote renders the content pretty well.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I want to really recommend buying a tablet which you can be comfortable reading PDFs on. 6 or 7 inch tablets just aren't good enough for most people to read PDFs on. I have an ipad 1 with the 10 inch screen and I still use it for reading technical manuals. </p>\n",

The best possible scenario would be for me to upload the files in some cloud storage and for her to open an app on her iPad, wait for it to automatically sync the files and start reading them. I don't want to go through the effort of explaining her stuff like \"Open this app, tap this and this button so that the book can be saved wherever and then open another app so taht you can read the damn thing\". As I already mentioned, I want to minimize the effort as much as I can on her part.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried with the Kindle and iBooks apps, but their cloud storages don't seem to like syncing ebook files.

    "body": "<p>Here's my two cents. </p>\n\n<p>First, this may not be what you want, but it's fairly easy to stock an ipad/ibooks with epub files. You can either email them to the account owner's email account or put links to it on a web page and just access the files from a browser on the ipad. </p>\n\n<p>An alternative to upload the kindle files to your Personal Documents feature so it appears in the Kindle app on the ipad. After you activate the app, the tablet will have an amazon.com email associated with it where you can email files. (Check the help on it on Amazon). </p>\n\n<p>There's a very important caveat. In late 2013 when I dropped files to my Personal Documents so they can be synced on my ipad's kindle app, all the ebooks would render terribly. (I had an ipad 1). After I did some checking, I learned that there was a bug in the ipad Kindle app which caused this to happen---and the only way to resolve it was to sync via itunes to your laptop via usb. Yuck!</p>\n\n<p>1 1/2 years have gone by and with later ipads and itunes, these issues may have been resolved. But the fact is that the Kindle app's native environment is in android, so you would expect there to be some translation problems for another operating system. </p>\n\n<p>On the Kindle app for Android, when you sync to Amazon's Personal Documents, everything looks fine. </p>\n\n<p>Also in Android, using the native \"Play Books\" app to sync ebook files works very well (I was impressed). You upload it into play books from your desktop (most of the time), and then it magically shows up on all devices sharing the same google account. Note that Play Books also renders PDFs well too. </p>\n\n<p>So to summarize, in my experience, the two best syncing solutions are in Android, not ipad/ios, and I have a slight preference for Play Books. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just see that Google Play Books is available from the Apple app store. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-play-books/id400989007?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-play-books/id400989007?mt=8</a> Because it's porting from android, I wouldn't expect its rendering on ios to be as flawless as it is on android, but it's updated often, and it's very easy to upload files to Google from any web browser on a desktop so that it renders on your ipad. That is probably what you want. I just downloaded the app and checked how it rendered ebooks. Looks great to me!</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I have Adobe Digital Editions installed on my computer.  Adobe Digital Editions is tied to my Adobe ID email address, <code>oldemail@domain.com</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Over the past several years, I have purchased several (non-public domain) ebooks from the vendor <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/\">ebooks.com</a>, both EPUB and PDF.  My <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/\">ebooks.com</a> account is, like my Adobe ID, associated with <code>oldemail@domain.com</code>.  </p>\n\n<p>When I purchase and then download ebooks from <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/\">ebooks.com</a>, I am given an <code>.acsm</code> file (\"Adobe Content Server Message\" file).  Once I have downloaded the <code>.acsm</code> file to my computer, I double-click on it, Adobe Digital Editions opens, and the ebook file (EPUB or PDF) is downloaded to my computer and automatically placed in Adobe Digital Editions.</p>\n\n<p>Once the ebook is in Adobe Digital Editions, if I right-click on it and select \"Item Info,\" it says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Permissions\nLicensed To: oldemail@domain.com\nurn:uuid:########-####-####-####-############\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>#</code> is a number <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> or a letter <code>a</code>-<code>f</code>.  When it says <code>Licensed To: oldemail@domain.com</code>, what does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>My overall question is, <strong>are ebooks tied to (i.e., licensed to) a particular email address?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Are they tied to a particular email address as soon as they are purchased <em>or</em> only when they are opened on Adobe Digital Editions for the first time?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Another way to ask this question is the following: <strong>which of the following statements is true?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>An ebook is tied to a particular email address <em>as soon as</em> it is purchased.  So if I purchase an ebook from a vendor (e.g., ebooks.com), the ebook is tied to the email address I used to purchase the ebook as soon as I click purchase.  In other words, if I use <code>oldemail@domain.com</code> to purchase an ebook from a vendor, I can <em>only</em> open that ebook using software that is authorized to <code>oldemail@domain.com</code>. </p></li>\n<li><p>An ebook is tied to a particular email address <em>only</em> when the <code>.acsm</code> file is actually opened and the ebook is loaded into Adobe Digital Editions (which itself is tied to a particular email address).  In other words, if I use <code>oldemail@domain.com</code> to purchase an ebook from a vendor, I can open it <strong>for the first time</strong> <em>either</em> with Adobe Digital Editions authorized to <code>oldemail@domain.com</code> <em>or</em> with Adobe Digital Editions authorized to <code>newemail@domain.com</code>.  However, <em>once</em> I open it with either authorization (either <code>oldemail@domain.com</code> or <code>newemail@domain.com</code>), the ebook is <em>forever</em> tied to that particular email address and I can no longer open it with the other authorization. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My issue is that I want to change my email address, from <code>oldemail@domain.com</code> to <code>newemail@domain.com</code>, without losing access to my ebooks.  To do this, do I need to ask the vendor (i.e., ebooks.com) to change the email address associated with my account, or do I need to just to redownload the <code>.acsm</code> files and open them in an Adobe Digital Editions authorized to <code>newemail@domain.com</code>?  Neither support team is at all clear on what I will need to do.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Let me say that I have no idea what the answer to your question is. So what follows is my best guess based on a hunch. </p>\n\n<p>First, it's ridiculous to think that a DRMed ebook is tied to an email. Instead, it is tied to a user account created for a specific vendor. Every website under the sun allows you to change the email for the account. Even if the sign on you use is the email I suspect you will be able to change the  email associated with it from account management on the user's site. </p>\n\n<p>Because I feel pretty sure of the first point, I think it's fair to assume that all instances of this app on different devices with the same  username will allow you to access that DRMed ebook. (the DRM may limit how many devices you can share it with). That is because the app probably checks with a central server. </p>\n\n<p>You are asking a question which is probably too vendor-specific. Different companies implement DRM differently. I am not sure whether a single Adobe account is used for other vendors or whether each vendor has its own  DRM server; probably the latter (even if they use an Adobe content server). </p>\n\n<p>DRM is notoriously buggy, so I'd check with the vendor instead of hoping for a general answer. But I think your issue is not with email but with the vendor's limit on how many devices can open the same DRM content. </p>\n\n<p>Finally I should add that my Adobe ID for using Adobe Digital Editions has nothing to do with the account I have for the ebook distributor. So I would expect that all Adobe DE's to be able to open and view the file. (But then again, I have no special knowledge here). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Updated thought:</strong> We need to differentiate between \"default account names\" (which can sometimes be identical to email address) and \"email associated with the user account\". For one ecommerce vendor, my account name is \"fakename@hotmail.com\" when in fact that address is no longer valid. Instead the email associated with the account \"fakename@hotmail\" is  \"fakename@gmail.com\" even though my account name is still \"fakename@hotmail\".  Confusing? Yes!</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I had similar problems since most of the (physics-related) articles I read have two columns of text and lots of equations and figures. I can recommend a free software tool called \"<a href=\"http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/\" rel=\"nofollow\">k2pdfopt</a>\" written by William Menninger. It re-arranges the text flow of PDFs and optimizes them to the size of the e-reader screen. I'm really impressed by the results. Most importantly for me, it renders equations correctly and it automatically detects and reflows text in columns (even from scanned PDFs). It's not a perfect world, though, e.g. it sometimes misinterprets a hyphen that happens to appear at the end of a line for a dash, so when the positions of line breaks change due to text reflow then the two words that should be separated by a hyphen are merged into a single word.</p>\n\n<p>You would run k2pdfopt on your computer and feed it with an article that you want to read. It outputs an optimized version of that article, which you can then transfer to your e-reader. As I use this tool a lot I wrote a browser extension that makes the conversion process a bit easier. It works with Chrome and Firefox and it adds a small button to your browser whenever you're navigating to the download page of a scientific article. If you click this button, the extension downloads the article, runs it through k2pdfopt, and optionally sends it to your e-reader. If you're interested, you may download the extension from <a href=\"http://dontprint.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">my website</a> (since I just know that some people are going to complain about alleged advertisement: please note that I'm not making any money with this browser extension and I'm just offering it to others because I find it useful and I don't see a point in keeping the program for myself. Also, I really think it's relevant to this question. So please, holster your weapons).</p>\n",

(BTW, Amazon-bought dictionaries can be sent to the Kindle for Android app.)</p>\n\n<p>Until Amazon fixes this, you can outsmart the Kindle for PC/OSX/iOS apps by changing the ASIN number of your custom dictionary to the ASIN number of one of the default dictionaries and overwriting the default dictionary with your custom dictionary. This involves the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Remove the DRM from the custom dictionary that you want to use. </p></li>\n<li><p>Download a dictionary that you won't use, e.g. the American English dictionary (<em>B003ODIZL6</em>_EBOK.azw). </p></li>\n<li>Open your dictionary with <a href=\"http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1927698\" rel=\"nofollow\">Java Mobi Metadata\nEditor</a>, change the existing ASIN entries to <em>B003ODIZL6</em>, save\nthe file, rename it to <em>B003ODIZL6</em>_EBOK.azw and copy it to the My\nKindle Content folder. (If your dictionary doesn't have ASIN entries, click the (+) button and select 113 ASIN <em>and</em> 504 ASIN.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Obviously, you'd use the ASIN number of the French monolingual dictionary, if you wanted to replace the default monolingual French dictionary with a bilingual dictionary etc. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>First, we need to define our terms more precisely. </p>\n\n<p>EPUB 2 uses the toc.ncx file to produce a machine-processed table of contents. It is not human readable but automatically appears in most ebook reading platforms. </p>\n\n<p>EPUB 3 allows the use of toc.ncx (for back compatibility reasons) but also allows a (human readable) \"navigation document\", which is an  HTML5 file including  this  tag: </p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;nav epub:type=\"toc\" id=\"toc\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(See this example: <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/EPub_3#Navigation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/EPub_3#Navigation</a> ) </p>\n\n<p>According to the latest Kindle Formatting guide and iBooksAssetGuide, Apple and Kindle both support the <strong>NAV</strong> tag in an HTML navigation document rather than using a toc.ncx</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you can create a TOC MANUALLY  using simple human-readable HTML. (In the Kindle Formatting Guide, this is referred to as a \"logical TOC\"). This does not replace the HTML5 navigation document or the (EPUB 2 friendly) tox.ncx file.  In fact, Kindle requires a logical TOC  in addition to a navigation document. You can create as many logical TOCs as you want, but Kindle strongly requires one or more. </p>\n\n<p>Using EPUB3 navigation documents (instead of toc.ncx), Kindle only supports three different guide items: cover, TOC and start reading location. iBooks is practically the same. If you do the NAV tag (i.e., the epub3 way), you do it by adding something called a LANDMARK <a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-types-landmarks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-types-landmarks</a> but right now the only one it recognizes is a landmark to denote where the ebook begins. So that does not help you now. LANDMARKS are very dependent on the reading system. </p>\n\n<p>However, there is another option. You could create an alternate \"logical TOC\" and keep this file \"hidden\" from the navigation document. There are two ways you can do this: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you are using toc.ncx (the epub2 way), you would add the <strong>attribute linear=\"no\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;spine toc=\"ncx\"&gt;\n&lt;itemref idref=\"cover\" linear=\"no\"/&gt;\n&lt;itemref idref=\"htmltoc\" linear=\"yes\"/&gt;\n&lt;itemref idref=\"alternate-toc\" linear=\"no\"/&gt; \n ...\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>alternate-toc would not appear in the reading system's table of contents. BTW, you see that for the first itemred, linear is also NO because Amazon doesn't want it to be in the table of contents. </p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If you are using an HTML5 navigation document, you can do this with the \"<strong>hidden</strong>\" attribute</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-hidden\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-hidden</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize:</strong> you can include as many \"manual TOCs\" as you want (and use some methods to hide them from the ebook system's builtin TOC navigation system). </p>\n\n<p>Finally I would recommend Matt Garish's book EPUB 3 Best Practices. It came out in 2013, but is still very current. It has a great section on epub3 navigation. (I just re-read it). Also, it explained how to make LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS and LIST OF TABLES which is sort of what you are looking for. </p>\n",

Perhaps the two most significant ones are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>background processing (syncing with cloud, WiFi detection, etc.) that might absorb at least part of the computational power,</li>\n<li><s>the way the data is stored on the local memory (Kindle main partition uses a FAT filesystem, which means that significant fragmentation is a possibility) that might influence the time required to access the index file.</s> <strong>EDIT:</strong> this is not the case for flash drives, so this is not actually influencing performances</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to optimize word look-up in general you might try to go off-line (in order to reduce background processing) <s>and to defragment the memory of your Kindle</s>. This done, the speed of word look-up should be very similar for all e-books (with a difference of maybe some milliseconds).</p>\n",

    "body": "<h2>In a nutshell</h2>\n\n<p>One way to make visible epub files copied directly on the Kobo file system is to use the Kobo browser once afterwards to download an epub file from the web.</p>\n\n<h2>Context</h2>\n\n<p>I did some more experimenting on my own, and finally succeeded, though\nI did not explore the precise boundaries of what can work and what will\nnot work. I am giving details, so that you know my experimental\nevidence. This is personnal experiment, not anything I read anywhere. So, get second confirmation if that info is critical for your purpose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are only interested in the result, and the technique to transfer\nebooks to your Kobo without any specific software, simply jump to the\nlast section od this answer.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My question was motivated by the fact that I wanted to transfer ebooks\nfrom my Linux computer to my Kobo eReader. I am running <a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calibre</a>, which\nI use to improve some of the ebooks, but for some reason that I have\nnot yet identified, it will not detect my Kobo when it is connected to the computer\nby a USB cable.</p>\n\n<p>So having read in various places that a Kobo can be seen as a USB\ndrive, on which ebooks can be copied, I tried as reported above without\nsuccess, but no indication of the reason(s) for failure. The files\nwere simply ignored, wherever I put them. <em>Performing a <code>sync</code> did not\nhelp.</em></p>\n\n<h2>The experiments</h2>\n\n<p>Then serendipity came to my help. I had been wondering for some time\nhow I could connect to book sources on the web. I did not know how to\nbrowse the web with the Kobo. And then I discovered the <em>hidden</em> web browser,\nwhich they consider experimental.\nIn <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/3084/browsing-the-web-with-your-ereader?\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kobo's own words</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since the browser is still a beta feature, some websites may not\n  display properly. Please note that the browser is not officially\n  supported by Kobo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, there is no indication in their <a href=\"http://download.kobobooks.com/ereader/guide/alyssum/userguide_en_US.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">user guide</a> (which I had read)\nof the very exixtence of that browser, and I had to search the web on\nmy computer to find it. Then I found <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/3084/browsing-the-web-with-your-ereader?\" rel=\"nofollow\">the help page that explains how to activate this browser</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried the Kobo browser to download a (DRM-)free book from the\nweb. It worked ... and (nearly) all the books I had copied by hand on\nthe Kobo file system became visible and readable. I am saying nearly\nall, because it actually saw only the files with an <em><code>.epub</code></em>\nsuffix. Those files had been copied</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>directly in the root directory of the Kobo file system,</p></li>\n<li><p>or in a directory <code>codex</code> I had created at the root of the Kobo file\nsystem,</p></li>\n<li><p>or in a subdirectory of that <code>codex</code> directory.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I did not check how deep the hierarchy can be.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the book I downloaded from the web was also stored by the Kobo eReader browser in the\nroot directory. However, books with DRM are clearly stored somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>I did not (dare to) check what happens when a file has a <em><code>.epub</code></em> suffix,\nbut is not an epub file. But I did check that ebooks placed in other\nlocations are not seen (of course, I checked only some locations), unless it is a user\ncreated directory hierarchy placed in the root directory.</p>\n\n<p>I added some more books to check for other means to make then visible to the user. Since downloading a book seemed critical, I was wondering whether a <code>sync</code> induced download would do the job (it does not).\nThen I added two <a href=\"https://store.kobobooks.com/fr-FR/collection/free-ebooks-multiple-languages?\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kobo (DRM-)free books</a> to my account on Kobobooks.com, and\nchecked in my computer that they were indeed added to my account on\nkobobooks.com.</p>\n\n<p>Then I performed a sync on my Kobo, and it did download the two\nbooks. But that did not make visible the books I had previously added\ndirectly in the file system. It is  worth noting that, though they\nwere (DRM-)free, these ebooks were not downloaded at the root of the file\nsystem, like the epub files downloaded by the browser.</p>\n\n<p>But when I downloaded an ebook from <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">project Gutenberg</a>, the new books I had\ncopied directly in the file system became visible in the book collection of the Kobo eReader.</p>\n\n<p>This is already longer than it should. So, I am skipping some details to give my conclusions, for what I understand.</p>\n\n<h2>Some basic know-how for adding (DRM-)free ebooks directly to the Kobo memory.</h2>\n\n<p>The key idea is that the Kobo eReader (or at least the Kobo Glo HD\nthat I use - but I suspect several of them work the same) has a web\nbrowser, which can be used to download books in your Kobo.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/3084/browsing-the-web-with-your-ereader?\" rel=\"nofollow\">The browser is somewhat hidden</a>, as Kobo considers it an experimental\nitem, not officially supported.</p>\n\n<p>The browser download the epub files right in the root directory. And\nthen calls some piece of software to integrate it into its\norganization of the ebooks collection. The nice point is that it checks all the non-standard (i.e. non system) files and\ndirectories that are present at the root level, so as to recreate the information needed\nto integrate them. Aa a result, it takes into account the fact that\nsome files may have been removed, modified or moved into a different\nsubdirectory.</p>\n\n<p>The only bad news is that (afaik) the only way to get that software\nexecuted is to download an epub file from some site with the Kobo\nbrowser.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, copying ebooks from your computer onto the Kobo, assuming\nthe computer does not have a web server, can be achieved by connecting\nthe Kobo to the computer with a USB cable. The Kobo is then seen as a\nmemory device, with a file system which can be mounted as usual (for\nexample on directory <code>/mnt</code> with : <code>mount /dev/sdc /mnt</code> depending on where it shows up, here on <code>/dev/sdc</code> --\nnote that it is not <code>/dev/sdc1</code>). Then you can copy epub files or file\nhierarchies at the root <code>/mnt</code> of this file system. Then you dismount the file system with <code>umount /mnt</code>, and make sure copying is terminated (Unix <code>sync</code> command) before removing the USB cable, if you will.\nFinally, you use\nthe Kobo browser to download at least one extra ebook (possibly always\nthe same one :-).</p>\n\n<p>This was described for a Linux system, but should be adaptable to any operating system.</p>\n\n<p>An important point is that all the epub files must have the <em><code>.epub</code></em> suffix.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that I have not been able to determine is whether these\nfiles can benefit from other services, such as cloud storage. But\nI am very moderately interested in the cloud anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Now, some other user may have better, simpler ways of achieving the\nsame result, or more, without using specific software such as Calibre. I find it a\nbit frustating not to be able to used Calibre because it will not\ndetect the Kobo USB connection on my machine. I would not mind using a degraded\nversion where I would have to tell Calibre when the Kobo is connected and where.</p>\n",

So your problem should have another cause. Which you apparently confirmed by testing on different devices or application software.</p>\n\n<p>What I noticed by experimenting with my Kobo is that, when an eBook\nhas been loaded and made visible to the Kobo, it may interpret reading\nproblems as caused by the presence of DRM, though that may not be the\ncase. And you get an error message that pretends that the book is DRM\nprotected.</p>\n\n<p>Typically that can happen if some mishap destroys the file or\nmoves it to another directory in the Kobo memory. That is easily done\nby accessing the memory directly, as done by tools such as Calibre,\nthough this should in no way be construed as suggesting that Calibre\nmakes such mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>From what I understood experimentally (so I may be wrong) The Kobo\nbelieves it has a DRM problem with that eBook until it does a scan of\nits memory, and refreshes its tables, which will then no longer point to a\nmissing ePub file. I am not sure what is the best way to force that scan.\nThe way I did it was by using the Kobo browser to download in the Kobo a DRM-free\nbook (I usually go to <a href=\"http://gutenberg.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gutenberg.org</a> for that).</p>\n\n<p>So it could be that your Kobo has some problem reading the file, for\nwhatever reason, and interprets it as a DRM problem, exactly as it did\nfor my missing/displaced files.</p>\n\n<p>My idea is not to give you a definite answer on what is wrong, as only\nyou can do that. It is more to suggest that the Kobo may interpret as\na DRM problem a problem unrelated to DRM.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>If I understand correctly, you are asking a multi-faceted question; on how metadata hurts or helps your website and ebook content.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize in advance- if some of this information is repetitive or overly descriptive. I'm providing as many descriptions, references and links as possible, in order to provide as thorough an answer as possible. Thanks. </p>\n\n<h1>Webpage Optimization</h1>\n\n<p><strong>1. What is Metadata:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Metadata is \"data about data\".[1] Two types of metadata exist:\n  structural metadata and descriptive metadata. Structural metadata is\n  data about the containers of data. Descriptive metadata uses\n  individual instances of application data or the data content.\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your question concerning the platform or website metadata is in relation to the \"descriptive\" purpose of the metadata properties, so let us focus on that aspect for the website only and not the ebook for now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Metadata \"Web Page\" Specific:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Web pages often include metadata in the form of meta tags. Description\n  and keywords in meta tags are commonly used to describe the Web page's\n  content. Meta elements also specify page description, key words,\n  authors of the document, and when the document was last modified.[5]\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata#Web_pages\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata#Web_pages</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Metadata Elements or \"Tags\"</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta elements are tags used in HTML or XHTML documents to provide\n  structured metadata about a Web page. They are part of a web page's\n  head section. Multiple Meta elements with different attributes can be\n  used on the same page. Meta elements can be used to specify page\n  description, keywords and any other metadata not provided through the\n  other head elements and attributes.\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>First Clue</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Metadata Web Page &amp; Elements or Tags section, provides us a beginning to an answer. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...authors of the document, and when the document was last modified.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Second Clue</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Meta elements can be used to specify page description, keywords and any other metadata not provided through the other head elements and attributes.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Metadata for Webpages (Partial Answer)</strong></p>\n\n<p>So this tells us at a minimum, the metadata for a webpage should contain at least,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Descriptive elements for the specific page description</li>\n<li>Keywords, that relate to that page or topic in general</li>\n<li>Authors of the document</li>\n<li>When the document was last modified</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>for full optimization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Metadata and Search Engine Optimization</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where it gets tough and there is no one size fits all type of answer, because we are now asking \"How do I research, find, and know which keywords to add\", depending on if you are optimizing for Google, Bing, or Yahoo you may have different needs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></p>\n\n<p>Learning about how each of these search engine services differ is important if you are trying to optimize your content. Personally, I'd recommend researching and learning about topics such as \"How Predictive Keyword Searches Work\", and similar SEO topics.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an article to start learning about Google Predictive Keyword Search:\n<a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/how-google-instant-autocomplete-suggestions-work-62592\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://searchengineland.com/how-google-instant-autocomplete-suggestions-work-62592</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyword Optimization Tools</strong></p>\n\n<p>Luckily there are optimization tools to help with this, one such example for finding keywords that people are searching in relation to your content is \n<a href=\"http://ubersuggest.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ubersuggest.org/</a> to learn more you may view their website.</p>\n\n<p>This becomes more complex, once you realize that you are now on the road to search engine optimization, yet you still have to optimize for the retail partners such as \"Amazon\", \"Apple\", \"B&amp;N\", \"Kobo\", \"Google Play\", etc. and other third party platforms as you mentioned such as \"goodreads, scribd\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>And it may be helpful to dig into the metadata keywords and descriptions of these retailers for knowing how to optimize for each or possibly all.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>As an example, looking at B&amp;N's website source code gives us some insight to consider:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"True\"&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"MobileOptimized\" content=\"320\"&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"format-detection\" content=\"telephone=no\"&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"author\" content=\"Barnes &amp;amp; Noble\"&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Barnes &amp; Noble | Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Lower Prices on Millions of Books, Movies and TV Show DVDs and Blu-ray, Music, Toys, and Games.

As metadata expert Renée Register has explained in a recent series of Digital Book World webcasts and blog posts, metadata refers quite simply to what you want the world to know about your books and provides a structure for helping them come to know it.</p>\n  \n  <p>When you want to sell your book online, the metadata will not only give potential buyers technical information such as the specifications, publication date, ISBN and list price, it will also be the magic that enables your book to be discovered online by customers who search for it. And this is all the more important for digital editions that can’t be hand-sold in bookstores.</p>\n  \n  <p>So when publishers ask themselves what technical metadata essentials they need to know in order to give their titles the best chances of success, the question they’re really asking is how they want to sell them. After all, metadata isn’t just a formula to be rigorously followed; it’s a tool publishers can—and should—adapt more creatively in order to experiment with different approaches to online bookselling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/when-bad-ebook-metadata-is-good-or-not/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/when-bad-ebook-metadata-is-good-or-not/</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imagine hundreds or even thousands of crazed readers can’t wait for an ebook title to be available for sale. And when it finally is, they go to Amazon and other retailers to buy it. But they buy the wrong ebook instead.</p>\n  \n  <p>When you’re Stephen King, those lost sales on an ebook edition for your print-only novel Joyland (Hard Case Crime) doesn’t make or break you. But if you’re Emily Schultz, the Canadian author of the 2006 literary fiction novel Joyland (ECW), those sales can be a huge windfall. (King’s Joyland came out in print last June and as an ebook this past April.)</p>\n  \n  <p>In October of last year, Schultz’s Joyland ebook was seeing an unexpected bump in sales — some 200 copies the week the King book came out. Those and subsequent sales provided Schultz with a pile of pocket money and she’s chronicling how she is spending it at her new Tumblr blog stephenkingmoney.tumblr.com. So far, she has spent just over $400 on things like a fancy dinner, more books and a haircut for her husband. She wouldn’t tell me just how much she has made (but hinted that it would be revealed on the blog eventually) but her take may be higher than you expect — she has a 50% royalty on the ebook, roughly double the going rate when working with a publisher...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Further in the article</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... While Schultz’s story is certainly atypical, it underscores the power and importance of metadata. Could better metadata, that is — keywords, descriptions, etc. — have saved at least some readers from finding or buying the wrong book, at least one or two of the disaffected ones who subsequently left negative reviews (residual metadata from this episode)? Is there something now that can be done in the metadata that will mitigate the effects of the negative reviews?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>eBook Metadata Clues from above articles &amp; quotes</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Now we know at minimum what is important for eBook metadata:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Technical information such as the specifications</p></li>\n<li><p>Publication Date</p></li>\n<li><p>ISBN</p></li>\n<li><p>List price</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As the article states metadata is a tool and not a rigorous formula but it is instead to be used as needed.</p>\n\n<p>See here at the Book Publishing company I work for we have over 180+ different nodes of metadata that we accept for ebook metadata because we provide service for all online ebook retailers each requiring different specifications.</p>\n\n<p>So, I apologize that this answer cannot give you  2+2=4 straight forward approach, but as you can see there is a lot involved with the question you asked.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Related Articles</strong></p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/using-metadata-to-market-books-build-audience-and-control-your-future/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/using-metadata-to-market-books-build-audience-and-control-your-future/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/metadata-a-strong-business-advantage-in-bookselling/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2013/metadata-a-strong-business-advantage-in-bookselling/</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts &amp;&amp; Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Working in this industry for almost three years now has allowed me to see first hand how metadata effects sales and performance of titles at various retailers. </p>\n\n<p>Metadata is very relevant, important and constantly growing more complex in this industry.</p>\n\n<p>Metadata is an industry of it's own in this field.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: If you follow all of this advice, I am certain it will help clarify the subject of metadata, will provide you the correct steps to take to perform the research and development needed; ultimately providing you a solution for your question.</p>\n",

    "body": "<h2>Forewords</h2>\n\n<p><em>I am assuming that the poster of the question calls\n\"<code>unrestricted books</code>\" the books that have no DRM, i.e., no technical\ndevices intended tp prevent some uses, such as copy, search, or\nadaptation to new reading devices. All books are born legally restricted by\ncopyright, at least today, until they enter the public domain. Very few rightsholders fully remove copyright\nrestrictions by providing adequate public licences.</em></p>\n\n<p>Though I have read many papers on the topic, and written some, I doubt there is such a\ndocument as requested in the question. The reason lies in the\n<strong>diversity of objectives of the numerisation projects</strong>, on the <strong>lack of\nstandard definition of what a book is</strong>, on the <strong>wide variations\nencountered on book counts in various studies</strong> (notably those concerned\nwith assessing the proportion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_works\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">orphan books</a> in various libraries).\nThe definition of a book depends on a variety of parameters, including\ncontent and purpose, commercialization, relevance of distinct\neditions, choice of illustrator, each of which may impact some numbers\nby an order of magnitude. Does the Bible count for one, or for one\nhundred thousands? What about Shakespeare's works, or Alice in\nWonderland? Does a single poem count as a book? What about a short story, a music score, a ship log, a catalog, a birth registry?  Recall that what figures may be available may have been\ncomputed with different issues or purposes in mind, hence with different visions (often not explicited) of what counts as a book, and of what counts as two different books.   Hence, rather\nthan pointing on a specific document as requested, I try below to give a direct\nanswer, based on figures I may remember or retrieve. But <strong>a short crisp\nanswer would be misleading given the very fuzziness of available\ninformation</strong>, and the fact that the question itself is thus\nunwittingly very imprecise.</p>\n\n<h2>Global assessment</h2>\n\n<p>The production of unrestricted books by <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Project Gutenberg</a> and similar\nprojects is tiny compared to raw digitization and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OCR</a>, as donne by\nGoogle and large public and academic projects, for example by national libraries. It is on the order of\n100 000 books, a magnitude order of 1/1000<sup>th</sup> of the total\nnumber of books, that seems to range somewhere between 50 and 130\nmillions, depending on how books are counted. Large digitization\nprojects like those led by Google, National Libraries and large\ninstitutions are about two orders of magnitude more productive, some producing several millions of digitized books, though\nexact numbers are sometimes hard to assess.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you consider quality digitization with proofread text and\nstructured formatting like the epub standard, efforts like the\nProject Gutenberg seem significantly more productive, as large\ndigitization projects produce only a few thousands, unrestricted,\nquality e-books (from what I have been able to check).</p>\n\n<p>This is not surprising since large digitization projects are intended\nmostly for <strong>preservation purposes</strong>, and for accessibility by the\nresearch community (or for <strong>indexation purposes</strong> in the case of Google), while Project Gutenberg and its likes are intended for <strong>availability/accessibility purposes</strong>, i.e. to give convenient access to existing literature to a wider reading public.  <em>Raw</em>\ndigitization for conservation performed by large project is fairly\ncheap and fast, while quality digitization require long and costly\nhuman intervention (about one order of magnitude higher), that can be\nwell covered by crowd-proofreading and editing.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect is that, while the total number of books is very large,\nonly a small fraction is of interest to a wide audience. So the\nrelevant corpus for Project Gutenberg is probably much smaller than\nthe relevant corpus for large digitization project that have to deal\nwith all kinds of archives, inventories and the like. This is\ncompounded by the fact that the books that are of interest to a wide\naudience are to a large extent still under copyright, hence much less\nlikely to be made available legally without restrictions, by any digitization project.</p>\n\n<p>This actually stresses the importance in the book count of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_works\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">orphan\nbooks</a></em>, and more generally of books not cared for by rightholders, and\nwhether they can, or cannot, be made legally available, with or\nwithout restrictions. This may represent on the order of half the\nbooks in copyright. In the USA, it is an important aspect of the legal\nbattle around the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Book_Search_Settlement_Agreement\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google Book Search Settlement Agreement</a>, and it is\nthe object of a <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livre_indisponible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">specific law in France</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, I would tend to believe that cooperative projects like the\nProject Gutenberg are the major source of unrestricted ebooks, if you\nconsider reading resources for a wide public. But, it makes little\nsense to compare the output of two types of projects that have different\npurposes, at least in the medium term.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it should be noted that preservation is probably a more urgent\ntask than high quality digitization. It is rather sound that\npreservation projects will avoid diverting much of their limited\nresources on costly high quality output, other than for public\nrelation purposes. Also, the mass of documents\ndigitized by large projects provide a good source of raw material for\nsmaller projects (in size) that are aiming for quality output\nthat has a chance of attracting some readership.</p>\n\n<p>We should also remember that digitization is not the only source of\nebooks. There are authors, publishers and institutions that produce a very significant number of\nnew books without DRM restrictions, though there may be legal\nrestrictions on use not enforced with DRM, as was the case before with\nclassical paper books.</p>\n\n<p><em>Though I spent significant time analyzing the question and writing the\nanswer with some figures to substantiate it, it ended up being far too\nlong, and messed up by the heterogeneity of sources. Hence I decided\nto cut it short here. If interested, you may read the rest in a\n<a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/revisions/6380/4\">previous version from the history of this anwer</a>, which contains some additional figures and references from various projects.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>2 related questions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/333/what-kinds-of-drm-are-used-in-ebooks-is-it-possible-to-purchase-drm-free-ebooks#comment492_333\">What kinds of DRM are used in eBooks?

Furthermore, besides the basic character\nrecognition, OCR may or may not involve various steps, often based on\nlinguistic analysis, intended to improve the result. Hyphen removal is\none such step, since there is usually no point in keeping hyphenation\nin the resulting OCRed text.</p>\n\n<p>See for example this question: <a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/566/how-to-remove-hard-hyphens\">How to remove hard hyphens?</a> or this\n<a href=\"https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/9043/Bauge2012-dehyphenation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Master thesis on Dehyphenation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing images is sometimes possible, but unlikely to give you\neasily usable results for textual purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Thus one must assume that you used one tool (ABBYY FineReader 11) to\nget a first OCRed document, and that your comparison did a second OCR on\nthe image to compare it with the first result.</p>\n\n<p>This may make sense, and help identify some possibly erroneous\nlocations in the OCRed text (though I do not know that it is used, as\nthere may be other ways). It is also likely that both OCR process will\nsometimes agree on making the same mistake, which then remains\nundetected.</p>\n\n<p>Now it is possible that one OCR system does hyphenation removal while\nthe other does not. Then the comparison of resulting files would show\ndifferences wherever there was an hyphen in the original image. BTW, does acrobat find (mostly) extra hyphens or missing hyphens?</p>\n\n<p>To do away with the problem would require that both OCR steps do the\nsame regarding hyphenation, either keep it or remove it. I would\nexpect that some OCR algorithms can be configured to do either which\nmight solve your problem.</p>\n\n<p>Note however that hyphen removal may sometimes be ambiguous, requiring\nsomewhat arbitrary choice. Thus if both OCR systems used for double\nchecking do hyphen removal, they may sometimes disagree on which\nhyphens should be removed, and there is not much one can do to avoid\nthis.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to avoid hyphens is to write a piece of software that will\nfilter out reported hyphen differences. How to do that depends on the\ncontext you work in.</p>\n",

PDF files with two columns are running smoothly and fast on kindle (from the performance point of view). The problem is that, in 100% zoom level, the text is very small and somehow impossible to read. (If you want to simulate the real size of text on 100% zoom level in kindle, try to zoom out the PDF in your PC screen until it is approximately 6 inches.)</p>\n\n<p>Possible solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Don't forget you can make pinch and zoom to make text bigger. Zoom levels are predefined and you need to use your finder to navigate manually.</p></li>\n<li><p>View the pdf in vertical(landscape) mode. Now the text is almost twice big and easy to read and navigate. </p></li>\n<li><p>If you can view the full article in your browser, then you can use amazon extension, namely <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">send to Chrome</a>. Now you can read the text and have any deliberate zoom level. The only downside is Latex math formulas are not appearing sometimes. </p></li>\n<li><p>Almost all academic papers are written in Latex format. You can convert the PDF to Latex then modify it to have better zoom level or even change the number of columns for kindle and then convert it back to PDF and finally send it to Kindle. For similar solutions and approaches, take a look <a href=\"https://tex.stackexchange.com/search?q=kindle\">here</a>. </p></li>\n<li><p>You can use wide range of other devices available with additional functionalities.

Almost all of their free books are available only for a day or two, but in any case to get them you will have to click through to a recognizable merchant site.</p>\n\n<p>Then, publishers like Baen Books offer a large number of their e-books for free as loss-leaders. You'll notice that it's highly unusual for them to give you more than the first one or two books in a series, and the rest will cost you retail.</p>\n\n<p>Another clue to legitimacy is if the site offers payment in multiple currencies: there's almost no chance that any site accepting payment in US$, GBP and EUR is legitimate, because very few books are made available from a single distributor worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, if a site seems too good to be true, google that site's name and the names of some of the authors.

Not only that, the book formats supports is great allowing you to read anything from comics (cbzs) to the industry standard epub files.

I have not used MS Word to do it (I make my ebooks in HTML), but I have lots of insights about images in kindle and have done a lot of testing.  </p>\n\n<p>Kindlegen will autoconvert images to the size/resolution appropriate for the device. BUT you need to make sure you start with a source image which is high resolution enough for it to be resized. </p>\n\n<p>I realize that the HTML --> EPUB --> MOBI might be different from MSWORD --> MOBI, but according to the <strong>Amazon Kindle Publishing Guidelines PDF</strong> they should be 300 dpi, RGB and should be able to display at 2x magnification across devices. Therefore, you really need to have the width be at least 1600 or 3200pixels at 300 dpi. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect that the source image you used was a crappy web image at 72dpi, and then even though you think it's resizing to acceptable quality levels, the low resolution computer monitor is not showing what it really looks like. That's why it looks small. I'm guessing that the  cloud previewer sees that it's a low quality image and it keeping it small because that will prevent pixilated rendering of images on some of its devices. </p>\n\n<p>You don't need to have graphics good enough to print, but it needs to be significantly better than a 72 dpi web graphic. </p>\n\n<p>(I Have cheated one time and increased a 300 dpi 600px wide graphic by opening it up in a separate graphics program and scaling it up to 1600, but that was a special case; the image detail was dense enough that it could be expanded without losing quality). </p>\n\n<p>MS WOrd may not let you see properties of images. If so, You may need to remove it from MS Word and then edit it in a graphics editor (which allows you to bump up the dpi and scale the resolution up) I would guess that you need an image width 1600px at 300 dpi. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the problem is that the MS WORD to MOBI method does not give you much freedom to tweak it. Amazon's instructions for these conversions are fairly superficial and lead to such issues as you have. </p>\n\n<p>From the standpoint of production, you might want to consider using Calibre (free software) to do conversions from MS Word to .mobi and then open things up in the Kindle Beta Previewer 3\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1003018611\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1003018611</a></p>\n\n<p>You're viewing the alleged ebook  in the cloud viewer. It's unlikely that what you are seeing in cloud viewer bears any resemblance to what you might see on a Kindle e-ink or Kindle tablet (especially on images). </p>\n\n<p>I do things in HTML/EPUB, and I spend most of my time trying to troubleshoot Kindle's use of images. It's hard -- especially because things might look fine on one device and crappy on another. (Kindle for IOS is its separate kind of hell). </p>\n\n<p>I test ebook images on  all my kindle files on Kindle previewer, Kindle app for Android, Kindle e-ink device and Kindle app for ios. (I don't have access to a kindle device -- though I have good reason to believe that Kindle app for android renders things similar to Kindle devices). </p>\n\n<p>The key thing (to summarize) is to make the graphic as high quality as possible. </p>\n",

It depends on the rendering engine―try to display the same file from the ePub in IE, Safari and Firefox or Chrome and compare the results to the ADE defaults.

    "body": "<p>What is the cost of an ebook? What criteria should I use to decide a\nfair price when the price is left up to me. How can I be fair to the\nseller and to myself?</p>\n\n<p>Several sites offers ebooks, often as bundles, at a low price, or at a\nprice to be chosen by the buyer, usually above a minimum threshold.\nExamples I have seen include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble_Bundle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humble Bundle and similar sites</a>, or\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Pick\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phoenix Pick</a>.  Phoenix Pick also sells individual books, many of which\nare classic (more or less old), but seems to be mostly established\nauthors, with significant price variations.</p>\n\n<p>Then you have sites like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smashwords\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smashwords</a>, more oriented towards indies\n(independent authors) who self publish. These are usually recent\nbooks, with little quality filtering (but is there much with some\nother publishers). Some books are free, others vary significantly in\nprice, and prices vary in time. Here again, some books  are sold for\nthe price the buyer will give.</p>\n\n<p>Thus I often wonder how much I should pay for an ebook, which is fair\nto the seller and to myself. (The problem is compounded in the case of\nbundles with the fact that one may be interested in only some books of\nthe bundle.)</p>\n\n<p>Hence I wonder what is the cost of an ebook, independently of the\ncontent value, which is the subjective part.</p>\n\n<p>AFAIK, and I did look into some actual figures, most of the price of a\npaper book goes into its more material aspects. More than 50% is due\nto printing, storing, transportation, bookstore costs, not to mention\nthe destruction of unsold copies. Hence, the cost of an ebook should\nnot exceed half the paperback cost, without penalizing the author or\nthe publisher. This does not seem to fit what I observe.</p>\n\n<p>There is the cost of digital formating, but from looking at the ebooks\navailable at the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/texts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Internet Archive</a>, it seem that many have been epub\nformatted mechanically. The result does leave much room for\nimprovement, but it shows that digital formatting remains a quite\ntractable task.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I am aware that contents matter. But still, what should be\nconsidered a reasonable payment for, say, the equivalent of 300 pages in\npaperback.</p>\n\n<p>To give a bundle example, Humble Bundle asked for a minimum of $15 for a\nrather good selection of 20 books, while Phoenix Pick asks a minimum\nof $7 for a selection of 4 books, a lower limit in both cases. </p>\n",

Having to fix my\nown price as an e-book customer is a new experience to me, and I was\nwondering how it is perceived and analyzed by other e-books customers\nand sellers. This type of pricing is not usual where paper books are\nconcerned.</p>\n\n<p>Is this off-topic on this site? I believe not. The <a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic\">topic page</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The main focus is on the processes involved in publishing and/or\n    consuming ebooks (and related tools), rather than on the content of\n    ebooks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though this does not explicitly include economic aspects, it does not\nrule them out. A question such as pros and cons of  publishing in XYZ\nformat can typically have economic answers.</p>\n\n<p>What is explicitly ruled out is questions about specific books or\nsites, or discussing specific ebooks or ereader retailers, when it can\nbe <em>shopping</em> or <em>opinion based</em>, which does not rule out technical\nquestions.</p>\n\n<p>My question is about pricing in the general sense, not specific items,\nand it is an issue that is seriously analyzed by professionals and\neconomists. It is a technical and scientific issue.</p>\n\n<p>Many documents do address this issue, for both traditional paper books\nand more recently for ebooks.</p>\n\n<p>It is true that many statements are opinion based, because all kinds\nof people have an opinion to voice, with or without competence to\njustify it (see <a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2012/consumers-upset-and-confused-over-e-book-pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Consumers Upset and Confused Over E-Book Pricing</a>). Some people have also an interest in keeping this fuzzy,\nso that their market is not understood or analyzed too closely,  especially by authors and consumers.</p>\n\n<p>My own usual references on books cost are not in English.\nHowever, I was  able to find rather quickly some new ones on the web,\nsuch as\n<a href=\"http://ireaderreview.com/2009/05/03/book-cost-analysis-cost-of-physical-book-publishing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book Cost Analysis – Cost of Physical Book Publishing</a>\nwhich does itself use several external references.</p>\n\n<p>This article agrees that about 50% of the printed book cost comes\nfrom distribution (10%) and retail (40%), to which one can add around\n10% of printing costs. This is reduced to nearly nothing in the case\nof e-books.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, ebooks have their own costs, but they are very unlikely to be\ncomparable to what is being saved (some more than 50%) on the material\naspects of printed books.</p>\n\n<p>What is more likely is that market behavior changes significantly, because eproducts have no marginal cost\n(it costs nearly nothing to make extra copies).\nThat is to be taken into account by both the producers and the\nconsumers of ebooks. One aspect of it is that the market is a lot more\ncompetitive as more authors can enter it (I am currently reading a\nvery nice ebook that is available only for free).</p>\n\n<p>Another consequence is that some sellers consider that letting the\ncustomer fix his own price, possibly within limits, is a good way to\ndo business. Why do they do this? Fixing my own price as a customer,\nin a way that is fair, also depends on my understanding of the\neconomics and of the economic analysis of the seller. There can be, as\nalways opinion based assessments of it: some people still have strange\nopinions about well established scientific facts. But this is clearly\na matter for scientific and technical analysis.</p>\n\n<p>The major point is that paper books both have fixed costs, independent\nof the number of books sold, and marginal costs for each (additional)\nbook. They also have a high investment cost in the printing, since it\nmust be done in large numbers to be economically acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>The ebooks business has a lesser up-front investment, because no mass\nprinting is needed, and no marginal costs (the more than 50% in\nprinting, distribution and retail. Once the book exist in epub, mobi,\nor whaterver, it is essentially free for the publisher (except for\nadvertising possibly, but that is done only when return is expected).</p>\n\n<p>What matters to the publisher is not the number of books sold, but the total\nincome it brings. Any addtional dollar is worth taking, since what is\ngiven in exchange no longer costs anything.</p>\n\n<p>That is probably the motivations for open pricing and bundle pricing.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I would think that what matters for the producers of ebooks is\nnot to get a given price for a book or a bundle, but how much of my\nmoney I will input in the book production system every month. Giving\nme additional books, that I will probably not read all, cost them\nnothing and may increase my inclination to buy.</p>\n\n<p>So <strong>my conclusion is that there is no real fair price for each\nindividual buy</strong>. Rather one should spend monthly a global amount\nproportional to one's means and one's amount of reading.</p>\n\n<p>The role of the seller is to induce a consumer behavior that will\nmaximize the total income, rather than the profit per book sold.\nOne role of the consumer is to make sure the producers can make a\nliving (and keep producing), which does imply a level of spending, but\nnot necessarily a high cost per book.</p>\n\n<p>This analysis may not be totally accurate, but it is fairly precise (in a qualitative way) and\ncan be disputed on objective facts and arguments, rather than opinions.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I don't have any substantial answer to your question, but I have been thinking hard about it over the years. </p>\n\n<p>Let me summarize some dynamics of ebook pricing and then talk about \"fair price.\" </p>\n\n<p>Ebook production is a very speculative business. You have no idea whether there even exists an audience for your product. </p>\n\n<p>Pricing for digital goods is elastic. You have very little capital costs (the supply is unlimited), and you can price it at whatever you want. </p>\n\n<p>Marketing and promotion is the most significant cost here, and there's some debate whether money spent on marketing and promotion even is cost-effective.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote elsewhere, (NAGLE’S FIRST LAW OF EBOOK PROMOTION AND DISTRIBUTION: Comparatively speaking, it requires more effort to persuade a reader to invest TIME in an e-book than MONEY).</p>\n\n<p>Big 5 have two reasons they can justify increased marketing expenditures: 1)selling the publishing brand and 2)subsidiary rights (movies, translations, TV shows, etc). For most books though, these potential revenue streams don't exist; therefore there's more shoestring marketing involved. </p>\n\n<p>An indie author could spend a lot of money on promotion and it might work, but it might make little difference. Publishers have more capital to spread the risk.</p>\n\n<p>Should the author be entitled to a fair price for his labors (in much the same way as a fair-trade coffee grower should be entitled to a fair share of the profits)? </p>\n\n<p>The more fundamental question is whether the author should be entitled to ANY profits. In other words, some profits are better than none. </p>\n\n<p>Is the author entitled to a fair contract with a publisher? This is harder to pin down because an author wants the publisher to have a substantial enough stake in revenues to have an incentive to promote the ebook. If a book contract gave an author 1% of royalties, in some cases that could be a good deal if the publisher could bring substantial volume. </p>\n\n<p>What attitude should the author have about promoting a \"fair price\" for the ebook?</p>\n\n<p>In 2005 (before the Kindle) I wrote this article about ebook pricing: </p>\n\n<p>DRM doesn't really matter for the little guy. It matters mainly for mega media companies who have made significant capital investments (in thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars) and need to recoup their investment by selling tens of thousands of copies. The pricing strategies of big publishers have pretty much been \"anti-chump change.\" In other words, set a retail price that no one seriously will pay (aside from library institutions) and then gradually lower the price until the merchandise starts moving somewhere (even if it is only to the remainder table). But for the independent content creator (say a popular litblogger who is selling ebook novels on his website) the pricing strategy is different. His strategy is not necessarily to maximize price, but to maximize audience. His strategy is to guess the price point readers would regard as \"chump change\" (so insubstantial that people used to getting things for free won't be bothered by paying it). This may not be the route to becoming a millionaire, but publishing royalties now aren't much better, and at least the poet or novelist doesn't have to wait forever to convince a publishing company to take a risk selling his work. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/16/143632/005\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/16/143632/005</a></p>\n\n<p>The problem here is that Big 5 publishers typically price ebooks at significantly higher levels than indies to pay for the marketing machinery. </p>\n\n<p>But low price is also a significant marketing device! Part of Amazon's genius is giving authors maximum control over how to price their ebooks and just giving them a consistent share of the profits. Therefore, the author can decide for themselves what is fair. </p>\n\n<p>Now that I have put these thoughts down, I have concluded that a \"fair price\" is whatever an author determines is the best way to receive a consistent stream of revenue over time... </p>\n\n<p>If an author prices a 1000 page novel at 99 cents,then that is a fair price (because the author assumes that the lower price will make you more likely to buy it). The author might be banking that you will buy future ebooks as well. </p>\n\n<p>One final thing. Places like noisetrade (and even Humble Bundle) let the buyer decide. There is some debate about whether this works (I think it works when you already have some visibility), but the advantage is that some people can compensate the author according to their subjective estimation of value. That might result in more revenue, or it might not. </p>\n\n<p>There is no magical formula, and every author and publisher is trying something different. I've learned not to dismiss any publishing or pricing model just because it doesn't resemble mine. </p>\n\n<p>One final thing. Every year on his Smashwords blog Mark Coker reports on what price has been shown to maximize revenue. I think his most recent survey revealed that $3.99 seems to be the most effective price for a new ebook-- and one might argue that empirically, this is the current \"fair price\" according to prevailing standards. </p>\n",

Then, Kindle shrinks the image to a size appropriate for that platform. </p>\n\n<p>Kindle definitely supports the css <strong>width</strong> property and <strong>min-width</strong> on KF8 devices and apps. But it does NOT support the max-width property.

With other platforms I could do it by using the css max-width property, but for the kindles, the images themselves needed to be blown up. For that reason, I used my graphics program to convert my 500px wide image to 2000 px. Yes, you risk pixilation for low quality images, but remember the widest ebook reading device is probably 10 inches. Even mediocre images still look decent at 2000 px on a 10 inch device. But the lesson learned is to use as high resolution images as possible, and let kindle's distribution program shrink the images as needed. </p>\n\n<p>E-ink devices from 2010 support KF8, so they should have the same display. But kindlegen will shrink the image so it's optimized for the specific device. </p>\n\n<p>For example, I have an image-rich epub file which is 7.5 mb.

It is all about taxes, which in Poland are really harsh. And people who get used to paper books - it is obvious what would they choose.</p>\n\n<p>And even because ebook \"production\" costs are way lower than printing a book, you can't see it because of the prices.</p>\n\n<p>I heard that the situation should be better soon but I hear it since two, three years already. And there's nothing going on except talking and talking about it.</p>\n\n<p>The worst thing is that ebook is considered as a service, not a product. Except when you buy ebook on a CD for example, then it is considered as a product and tax value is 12% different (polish example). But hey - it is unluckily still not that much. Because we are still talking about tax cost difference, not 12% of the whole ebook price. Ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>As I run a blog about electronic way of reading, I see that a lot of people are sceptical to pay for something they can download for free or have it in a paper version. They still keep a distance to buy something that they can't touch.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow, the most popular way people are buying ebooks here are discounts, which can be really huge and you have a possibility to buy a few ebooks in a bundles which you mentioned. We have a polish portal that works like a comparision site which alerts you via e-mail when there is a discount on ebook that you are interested about. On a bigger bookstore events you can get your ebook for even 90% (!) less price (example of a last holiday event of one of polish bookstores - \"Napoleon the Great\" by Andrew Roberts which is a huge and expensive book was about 90% cheaper).</p>\n\n<p>Going back on taxes topic - I heard that France and Germany made a revolutional change of pricing and made the taxes for ebooks way smaller. But then EU came up with anger that it conflicts the constitution and rules and I heard that it doesn't work the way they managed anymore... That doesn't help as well...</p>\n\n<p>Content? I don't think so. Unless it is for example a historical, huge book which costs in normal way a lot (again the closest \"Napoleon the Great\" by Andrew Roberts example), the difference in ebook price is much more seen than in case of a 'common' popular (f.e. fantasy, thriller) book/ebook which costs - let's say - a half of it in the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>I don't say that ebooks should be close to be free-to-download. I just say that if you would see for example up to 50% difference between paper version and ebook version, people would be much more interested in convincing themselves to read ebooks. And what comes after - a scale of a piracy would be way lower.</p>\n\n<p>And it wouldn't harm the paper books sale for sure. Because if someone like to have impressive library - they will buy paper books anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Because no matter how - reading counts in every way.</p>\n\n<p>But let's be fair and don't pay for something you can avoid.</p>\n\n<p>And the most important: Less price = higher sales, doesn't it work like that?</p>\n",

(They charge a monthly fee for renting the software which is quite reasonable). Then you can convert the epub file to kindle .mobi file by using the Kindle Previewer. </p>\n\n<p>Another solution is to pay a formatter or a publishing company to produce the book. Surprisingly, it is not particularly expensive (you can probably pay about $250-$500 for the job -- possibly less; I should know because that's the work I do). If you're not comfortable with technical stuff, paying for that might be easier. </p>\n\n<p>Some more ebook options are discussed in the \"Amazon Kindle Publishing Guidelines\" (Version 2015.4) (For some reason, the URL is always changing; you may have to hunt a while on amazon.com to find it). </p>\n\n<p>Finally there are several tools that I have not mentioned. For example, you can use MS Word to print a pretty awesome printed book. I have done this before using the MS templates specifically for books. (After googling  \"book MS Word template\" I found a great template from one book designer for less than $50-- it looked great). </p>\n\n<p>For producing epubs, you can use calibre or sigil or something similar. </p>\n\n<p>The key thing is downloading the Kindle Previewer program from the Amazon site to convert from epub to .mobi </p>\n\n<p>I'm making the production process sound a lot easier than it really is.

I usually encounter these kinds of scrambled pages issue when first reading an ebook.

(They even make it rather hard -- though not impossible to send files directly to the device app without using the cloud). You can use itunes to add a file into the IOS app (using the \"File Sharing\" function in itunes; connect the device, select the device --> Summary --> Apps --> (scroll down and select Kindle app and then choose Add file). </p>\n\n<p>Maybe (hopefully) Calibre lets you add files to the ipad. But this is a one way street. Amazon wants to make it impossible for you to have direct access to the ios file system. </p>\n\n<p>But you may appreciate my perspective. </p>\n\n<p>The Kindle app for ios is a truly wretched app for rendering ebooks. As an ebook publisher and formatter, I spend a huge amount of my time trying to make the ebook look less-than-crappy on the Kindle app for ios. (by comparison, It's a breeze to format for Kindle on android or the Kindle devices). Most of my ebooks just look horrible on the kindle for ios. I make a lot of compromises. </p>\n\n<p>The rule of thumb is to try to <strong>use whichever ebook reader  is native to the device</strong>. Ibooks is a best-of-class ebook reading software and certainly the best ebook reading app on ios. If you're buying from a third party (Smashwords?) you should have gotten an epub version and just emailed it and opened it in ibooks. It would look beautiful! </p>\n\n<p>From a practical point of view, I sometimes read purchased ebooks from Amazon on my ipad app. That is unavoidable. But for reading third party stuff on your kindle app, you should be using the  Send-to-Kindle function to get into the cloud, then go to the website and choose the device you want to deliver it to. </p>\n\n<p>Your question is seeking to break through the Kindle app's DRM. Besides being possibly illegal, it also will be technically hard to do. I realize that you probably obtained the ebook file legally. I am unclear what you mean by sharing function. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you should log in to the Kindle Personal Documents service via computer, go to <strong>\"Manage your content and devices</strong>\" , for show, select <strong>Docs</strong>, select the file and click the <strong>Actions</strong> button and then choose <strong>Deliver</strong> from the popup. That's the primary way you share Kindle ebooks across devices. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, a personal recommendation. Even though I have never bought an ebook from the Google Play store, their Play Books app is phenomenal and is the best share-across-devices-and-platforms solution. Works great on ios, Kindles, androids, Windows. They have an easy-to-use interface for uploading epub files to the cloud.</p>\n",

If you're \"sending to Kindle\", that obviously is not using USB. </p>\n\n<p>I think what you're using is \"Kindle Personal Documents service\" to send it to a specific device. </p>\n\n<p>The key question is whether your company owns the devices in question. If yes, then it also is controlled through a single Amazon account, in which case it would be fairly easy to delete and swap  old Kindle files remotely. </p>\n\n<p>To  log in to the Kindle Personal Documents service via computer, go to the Amazon account options, choose <strong>\"Manage your content and devices\"</strong> , for  <strong>show</strong>, select <strong>Docs</strong> . Under <strong>Actions</strong> choose <strong>Delete</strong>  and that should do it. </p>\n\n<p>I'm guessing that everyone owns their own device and use their personal Amazon login for it. I'm also assuming that each device  has listed a specified employee's email as authorized to receive  Kindle files from via  the Personal Documents service.

If I send different versions of a file to a device, I usually rename the ebook's title (which is not the same as the name of the file).</p>\n\n<p>If you don't have a single login for all devices (but are simply sending things from an authorized email to the devices), you do not have access to the user's <strong>Manage Your Content and Devices</strong> screen; therefore, you could not swap files. </p>\n\n<p>To give a different perspective here, I prefer the Google Play Books solution for syncing ebooks to the Kindle solution. (For one thing, Google accepts epubs instead of a proprietary file). Google Play Books doesn't let different emails share files. But Google Docs/Drive is really good about allowing files to be synced and shared. </p>\n\n<p>One solution might involve keeping the most recent epub/doc/pdf on a Google drive and let people manually transfer it to Google Play Books. (You could use a plugin like this: <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drive-epub-pdf-book-to-go/fabbklgdcbijclhlffpmllpgnkalmbfd?hl=en-US\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drive-epub-pdf-book-to-go/fabbklgdcbijclhlffpmllpgnkalmbfd?hl=en-US</a> ). But this still requires that each user make the manual step of connecting files from Google drive to Google Play Books. </p>\n\n<p>If you can sync the file as a PDF or Word or ODT file, then you can stick the file onto your own G-drive (preferable in a separate <strong>EMPLOYEE DOCS</strong> shared folder), then each user could install the Google Docs/Drive app and then you could do a read only share with every user; that would let you always have a shared and synced copy of the file. </p>\n\n<p>The only caveat about the Google solution is that might need employees to have offline access to these docs. I just checked and the Google Docs app has an option for each document which allows you to view the document offline. You would probably need to verify that Google would update a doc if an employee has chosen to make it viewable online. </p>\n\n<p>(I suspect that MS Office might have a syncing method as well). </p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize:</strong> Kindle doesn't seem to let you sync files among devices; it just lets you add new files. If the files you need to share can be PDFs/DOC files, then it would be easier to put them on the Google Drive and then share the files with users. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>First, I wanted to say: your goal is laudable; there is nothing wrong with wanting a simple ebook reader just for reading rather than a multipurpose device. Keep in mind that for most ebook readers network access will be needed to provide purchased content (Generally, although there are ways to add purchased content via usb for most devices). </p>\n\n<p>The 3 questions I would want to ask are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Would you be satisfied with a black and white low-energy device, or do you need color?</li>\n<li>Do you need to read a PDF?</li>\n<li>Do you want to have access to books from the big publishers? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you need to read a lot of  PDFs, unless you have good eyes, you should try to get a large display 8 inches or more. </p>\n\n<p>If you need to buy books from big publishers, then you probably want to buy a device with DRM on it. Either you want a Kindle or Nook or Kobo device, and you need to load the ebooks manually. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the e-ink devices (even the old ones) are single purpose devices which  work perfectly well, and frankly, even though they have wifi, it's so clunky to surf on it that you might as well be offline. I have owned several kindles, and I don't think I have ever gone surfing on the Net more than 2 or 3 times. </p>\n\n<p>Even though I'm not enthusiastic about the Kindle ebook format, their devices are great, and there is a certain minimalist appeal about the e-ink devices. I would buy any kindle -- I would seek out a certified refurbished version of any model produced from 2014 forward  (I have one from 2010 which I still use!), It's possible to get lost in comparing specs, but the differences between them are rather small. I would pay attention to battery life, whether there are actual buttons on the device (as opposed to virtual ones) and possibly if you are a book fiend, buy one with a SD/microSD memory slot. Also, Kindle has a lot more free and discounted content than other platforms. </p>\n\n<p>You could certainly go used, though unless you are really cost-conscious, I would spend at least 50$. I would recommend that you try to buy a \"certified refurbished\" model of whatever you like.</p>\n\n<p>If you are buying a device for someone and want to block their ability to surf, keep in mind that both the android tablets and kindle tablets already have parental controls  to set daily quotas on usage. </p>\n",

Those are both good for storing annotations and keeping track of versions. Also, both software have all sorts of mobile apps and syncing solutions. </p>\n\n<p>Here's an interesting thing. If your file is an epub and if you have uploaded it to Google Play Books (GPB), then when you annotate the epub file, the annotations will be stored in a (versioned) Google Docs file for your account.

    "body": "<p>First, I've formatted lots of poetry for epubs, so I can offer insights. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know about what kind of visual demands you have for poems. But I'm assuming that you have the usual ones -- keeping lines of a stanza together, having the proper indents and line widths and forcing page break. </p>\n\n<p>Poetry is easier to format by creating HTML and css style sheets. </p>\n\n<p>The html source looks something like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"stanza\"&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\"stanza\"&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; \"Look not thou on beauty's charming, – &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; Sit thou still when kings are arming,  –&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; Taste not when the wine cup glistens,  – &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; Speak not when the people listens,  – &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; Stop thine ear against the singer,  – &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; From the red gold keep thy finger,  – &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; Vacant heart and hand, and eye,  – &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"line-verse\"&gt; Easy live and quiet die.\"&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Admittedly, this is a plain vanilla example. Depending on the formatting, you may want to use two different classes for individual  lines with different styles. Look at this css</p>\n\n<pre><code>p.line-verse {\n    text-indent: -2em;\n    padding-left: 3em;\n    padding-right: 3em;\n    line-height: 80%;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You get the point. Once you have the css right, it is trivial to create html pages for poems. More examples are here: <a href=\"http://epubsecrets.com/formatting-poetry-in-epub-part-1.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://epubsecrets.com/formatting-poetry-in-epub-part-1.php</a> and <a href=\"http://epubsecrets.com/formatting-poetry-in-epub-part-2.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://epubsecrets.com/formatting-poetry-in-epub-part-2.php</a></p>\n\n<p>The two issues you have are: 1)would the advantage of being able to style poetry in html and css outweigh the convenience of using a word processor and 2)are you testing the poetry book adequately on different devices? Poetry can look bad on mobile devices, so you need to make sure they render reasonably well on all devices. </p>\n\n<p>It may simply be easier to pay someone to format an ebook for you and then keep the template for later ebooks. Or you can crack open any epub file of a poetry ebook (.epub is just a zipped file with the file extension renamed). </p>\n\n<p>Or you can unzip any of the Project Gutenberg poetry ebooks (which are formatted pretty well: <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Poetry_%28Bookshelf%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Poetry_%28Bookshelf%29</a> ). </p>\n\n<p><strong>To summarize my answer:</strong> It is actually not hard to format poetry for html; it actually can be easier than doing it from a converted word processed file. My feeling is that using word processed documents as your source creates more problem than it solves when you're trying to format something like poetry. Fixed layout books would definitely provide more pixel accuracy, but the ebook's appearance would be unpredictable on smaller devices. </p>\n",

You will probably have to cut  the pages out of the book so they lay perfectly flat on the scanner. A scan of a curved page is a huge source of OCR errors. </li>\n<li>Use OCR to extract the text from the images and save book to a text file. Depending on the font, the smudges in the images, and other factors like straightness of lines of text, you might get 70-90% accuracy. </li>\n<li>Proofread by hand every word. </li>\n<li>Construct ebook in the format you want. I markup my text files with MultiMarkdown, and then I have a program which converts that to an EPUB. I just like MMD better than editing HTML. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Abbyy Finereader is one of the best OCR programs out there but pricey. <a href=\"https://finereaderonline.com/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a site</a> where you can OCR a few pages using their software, but there are limits.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a PDF full of images (which is what much of the free books in Google Books is) try doing OCR <a href=\"http://www.online-convert.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">at this site</a>, again there may be limits to PDF file size you upload. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, proofreading is a very time-consuming task. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: PGDP does not allow requests to digitize books.

They supposedly did many Google books, but I can't find that many there were actually edited. If you use Captcha to crowd source proofreading, it might cost you money.

Also, it might help to use css which allows you to force a new page. Sample code here: <a href=\"http://www.paulsalvette.com/2012/04/adding-page-breaks-for-your-kindle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.paulsalvette.com/2012/04/adding-page-breaks-for-your-kindle.html</a> (Keep in mind that ebook support for page breaks has improved but is still lacking in Google play books). </p>\n\n<p>Creating hyperlinks in HTML for epub files is extremely simple. Unfortunately ibooks author probably generates a lot of hard-to-edit code (I'm guessing).  If you can unzip the .epub (an epub is just a zip with its suffix renamed to epub), you can probably make those changes manually. But that might be a lot of trouble. </p>\n\n<p>Actually if you're testing the links, you could probably test with Adobe Digital Editions or the Readium in Chrome</p>\n\n<p>I don't know why you choose ibooks author, but you probably would have had more luck with creating your ebook in sigil.

The ebook viewer should directly use the image data, but it obviously doesn't (and that is even less trivial than writing a Python based extractor of the text layer). </p>\n\n<p>I tested viewing a DjVu file <em>without text layer</em> on a recent version of the Calibre ebook viewer. It shows nothing, which confirms my expectation.\nIt could be that the ebook-viewer just picked up the DjVu plugin by using the same interface as the convertor, that would make sense, but in the case of DjVu files that is not the right approach. IIRC there was no way to provide such a plugin and tell Calibre it should only be used for conversion (and not for display).</p>\n\n<p>You're not doing anything wrong. I would rather say this works as can be expected knowing the implementation, but that doesn't make it very useful for books that are not paragraph oriented. So in your words: it is converting the books to some basic format. And this is not easily/quickly fixed.</p>\n",

I tried with <strong>8\"</strong> hi-res screen but it was just too small.

In 2012 I started to use bespoke Linux based <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Boox_M92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Onyx Boox M92</strong></a> and then in 2014 upgraded to Android based <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Boox_M96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Onyx Boox M96</strong></a>, both 9.7\" electronic ink ereaders. At present there are newer <strong>N96</strong> (dual touch) and <strong>N96ML</strong> (touch + frontlight) 9.7\" Android devices and 13.3\" <strong>Onyx Boox Max</strong>. There is also 13.3\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Sony_DPT-S1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Sony DPT-S1</strong></a> but it runs custom Linux (limited software choice). </p>\n\n<p>You don't list these as requirements but there are some things of secondary importance after the screen that still quite matter to me in the reader I have: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>very long battery life since the screen doesn't use it once the page is displayed</li>\n<li>ability to install Android apps (dictionary, cloud client, VPN client etc.)</li>\n<li>connectivity (wifi, bluetooth)</li>\n<li>external storage (microSD cards)</li>\n<li>and finally ability to scribble/highlight/erase as I would do in a normal book. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One potential disadvantage of ereaders - they are not very powerful.

Adobe ID has a monthly subscription, so even though it's a premium product, in many cases you're only using it for one or two months. You might be able to buy some low cost Adobe ID templates, so you don't have to set everything up. </p>\n\n<p>I use a Docbook solution (with Docbook XSLT, using the Oxygen XML editor software). This produces output very easily in html, epub and pdf, although the learning curve is high. (Also, Oxygen XML license is pricey for commercial use). Docbook can do code blocks very easily; on the other hand, when producing pdfs, you have limited formatting options. Oxygen uses the open source Apache FOP (which lets you output from Docbook XML to PDF), but there are commercial options (in the 200-500 range) which let you produce nice looking PDF files. (Check out renderx and antenna house). Docbook can do output for webhelp, javahelp, htmlhelp as well. Docbook works well, but the toolchain is hard to set up. </p>\n\n<p>A \"dumb but effective\" solution might be to code your output in HTML, paste it into MS word (to produce a PDF), and then to use SIGIL to move the html files into epub. Or use the MS word file as the source for doing output using Calibre. </p>\n\n<p>There are pros and cons for each solution. I haven't used pandoc, but it sounds like a good solution if you have lots of legacy latex content. </p>\n",

I say this because I'll be reading mostly under the sun, so what I really need is a good contrast which will allow me to read perfectly using natural (even intense) light, like a real book. I've read capacitive layers can negatively affect this.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I've heard to have a good rendition of PDFs you have to get close to natural size of the page. But I've seen big screens tend to have a much lower resolution than small screens. Is it just to limit manufacture costs? Isn't a good resolution more important?</p>\n\n<p>Note: I know similar questions have already been asked, but I didn't find any really satisfying answer. In the meantime technology went forward, so I'm asking what the options are in 2016.</p>\n",

I build my epub files in another way (Docbook XML --> static HTML --> EPUB) -- but when testing/editing, I view each chapter and the table of contents web page in a browser. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know if Sigil has a button to turn your files into an epub file, but my guess is that at some point, the chapters and TOC exist as  HTML files. Even if they don't, you could simply rename the .epub to .zip and then unzip. </p>\n\n<p>The file tree for epubs are fairly standard; here's what's generally inside. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>OEBPS</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.html</li>\n<li>toc.html</li>\n<li>2.html</li>\n<li>my.css</li>\n<li>images/</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>META-INF (navigation stuff and metadata inside) </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could just ftp the oepbs directory to your website and you'd have all the static pages there (you might need to rename the toc.html to index.html so that's the default view. An index file in ebook usually doesn't refer to the TOC but the subject index at the end of the book. </p>\n\n<p>So SIGIL could probably get the job done (and is especially recommended if you are using internal links between web pages), but a simple html editor would work just as well.

(It's free and a cool feature in your kindle account): </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_pdoc_main_short_us?nodeId=200767340\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_pdoc_main_short_us?nodeId=200767340</a></p>\n\n<p>I haven't really looked at PDF conversions from the PDS; I'm guessing it will look really ugly. But I suspect the Kindle conversions to PDF are better than calibre's (although calibre might let you fine tune it). Using Kindle eink to read PDFs is usually a disappointing experience unless the document is short and very simple. </p>\n\n<p>I glanced at the document. (I have made similar kinds of documents using Docbook XML). This document was optimized for PDF; you will lose a lot of formatting by trying to convert it -- though ironically it's pretty easy to convert it from Docbook XML to epub files. </p>\n\n<p>To answer your question, the .opf is a file that stores epub metadata; apparently calibre needs to convert the PDF first to epub, and then reconvert it to the kindle .mobi format. That's why the end result is so horrifying. </p>\n\n<p>Also: If you have access to an android tablet, you could upload the file to Google Play Books website and then read the PDF perfectly in the Google Play Books app on your device. </p>\n",

I've converted several PDFs into text, then Markdown, and then into an EPUB. Markdown is not as \"cluttery\" as say, raw HTML, so it's easier to read. And it's easier for beginners to learn for a markup language. Plus, any Markdown can be converted to many different formats given the right convertor program, like <a href=\"http://www.pandoc.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pandoc</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, Markdown is valuable because it's a starting point to make other formats. Part of my job is finding a \"base format\" for organized data, and text, so I can convert that to other formats for a wide variety of customers. So the concept of a \"base format\" is very important to me.</p>\n\n<p>Markdown is valuable for ebooks because most ebook readers only support a very small subset of the EPUB spec anyway.

    "body": "<p>Ultimately this question is unanswerable because digital purchases involve an element of trust between content creator and distributor. </p>\n\n<p>This is a real issue with the arts business, because fixed expenses by publishers  get tacked onto royalty calculations. Also, with creative content, budgets tend to be smaller, so there is less urgency for audits and confirmation. Smaller publishers also have less staff and infrastructure to do record keeping in a timely fashion. </p>\n\n<p>But even with Amazon.com and similar kinds of companies, you can't really know. Amazon provides great reports of sales and royalties, but sometimes reporting is interrupted for some reason. Generally, though I have no reason to disbelieve Amazon's numbers. It's hard to imagine why a company like that would want to fudge the numbers -- though accounting software can be fallible or wrongly programmed. </p>\n\n<p>Even with all the Amazon reports, it is rare that I as a small publisher have time to go over individual report. </p>\n\n<p>I imagine that if you suspect foul play, an individual author can buy a number of ebook copies himself and compare against weekly sales reports. Obviously, that costs money, but ebooks are typically low-volume areas, so you probably could see sales jumps pretty easily. </p>\n",

BY-SA is definitely one of the most lenient licenses -- aside from the public domain (where there is no obligation to give attribution). </p>\n\n<p>For example, I publish a lot of my fiction under BY-SA, so people can make commercial use of my fiction (I don't care). The only condition is that it be labeled properly and that you identify the source of the text. If you take BY-SA content which is NOT public domain, then you are obligated to make clear that your product is also BY-SA.  This can raise an issue if you are selling something which consists of BY-SA stuff and maybe copyrighted images. </p>\n\n<p>I have solved this incompatible license issue by mentioning in the credits that the text is BY-SA but the images are copyrighted (or some stricter version of the CC license). </p>\n\n<p>From an editorial standpoint, it makes sense to disclose that you have made some small changes (or big ones, if that is the case). </p>\n\n<p>Glancing quickly over the material so far, it looks like a LOT of the works there are not just BY-SA but are actual public domain.

There's no footnotes, boxes or references, but my ebook did have a bibliography. Important: I included a reference to an embedded font -- which you must  delete (I think epubcheck won't validate with a bad font reference). </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>CHM and epub are based on html files, but generally the production method for chm determines how simple the code is. Often the HTML files in the CHM files are made of complicated code which confuse calibre.  </p>\n\n<p>The first question to ask is: why do you want to convert it to epub? 1)Because you have one special file  you wish to read in that format or 2)eventually you want to republish (i.e., \"repurpose\") the content so that others can read it in an epub reader? or 3)you have many different chm files you wish to convert. </p>\n\n<p>If you need it just for your reference, I would try skipping the step of converting to epub and just look for a chm reader on your device. Android and Ios have decent apps which can read chm files natively. That is always the best option. </p>\n\n<p>I tried converting a simple chm to epub using calibre. Guess what? All the hyperlinks work for me. It sounds as if you are saying that the glossary for your chm contains all the definitions, and the problem is that every defined word goes to the top of the page (instead of going to the right part of the page).  My test files don't have anchors, so I cannot see what you are talking about. </p>\n\n<p>To diagnose the problem, you need to view the source of the chm and epub. </p>\n\n<p>The first step is renaming the epub to zip and then unzipping everything so you can see the html. Then open one of the files in a text editor (or open it in a browser, right click and select VIEW SOURCE). </p>\n\n<p>You can also view source in a chm file on Windows. Just right click on the topic with a defective hyperlink, view the hyperlink and see what is supposed to happen. </p>\n\n<p>From doing these two steps (and especially the first), you can see why the hyperlinks in the epub are not working. Perhaps epub stripped the part of the hyperlink that would put the target hyperlink to the middle of the page. \nNormally it should look like this <code>&lt;a href=\"first.html#elephant\"&gt;</code> where \"elephant\" refers to the anchor in the middle of the page. </p>\n\n<p>Another possible cause of the problem is that the chm file might be doing weird stuff. Perhaps, depending on the authoring tool which produced the chm file, javascript is making the anchor (I'm guessing randomly here). </p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that when producing the epub file from chm, for some reason calibre removed the anchor references. If the glossary page does not have something like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h2 id=\"elephant\"&gt; or &lt;a id=\"elephant\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it will be impossible for the hyperlink to find the anchor on that file. </p>\n\n<p>Calibre gives you powerful tools (like regular expressions) to rewrite certain code when converting. (although it may take you a while to learn how). If you are motivated, you can probably just re-edit the html files and make sure the references work and then rezip it again and rename the file extension to epub.  </p>\n\n<p>Again, without seeing the HTML source, it's hard to know where the problem lies.  But again, finding an chm reader to read the file natively would probably be the easiest thing to do. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>The short answer is that with few exceptions you should NEVER need to scale down .mobi files because Amazon.com will do it for you. </p>\n\n<p>I think 5.5 MB is a reasonable file size for an epub file. I don't know if it is a typo, but 60MB is a bit high for mobi files. </p>\n\n<p>However, when you buy a .mobi file directly from the publisher, the preferred way to get it to your device is to upload it to Amazon's Personal Document Server which will feed it via wifi to your device.<br>\nSee: <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2484180,00.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2484180,00.asp</a></p>\n\n<p>For mobi files, I do NOT recommend trying to transfer it to your device via USB because it requires you to put a bloated file onto a device which may not be ready to process it. </p>\n\n<p>Uploading it to Amazon.com first will let Amazon to send to device a file size appropriate for it.  </p>\n\n<p>I was testing an ebook before I published it on Amazon.com. The epub file had high quality graphics and  was 7.6 MB. The Mobi file was 16mb, but after I uploaded it to the Kindle's Personal Document server, I think the Kindle e-ink device only needed to download a smaller 1.5 MB file size to the device. It looked perfect even at that smaller size.  Amazon reduced the size and resolution of graphics to match the device. </p>\n\n<p>(It's possible that O'Reilly has multimedia files which are causing the bloat, but i doubt it.) </p>\n\n<p>Some authors and publishers have problems optimizing their graphics and file sizes, but the Oreilly guys producing those ebooks are the best in the industry. So they are providing a book optimized for several different platforms and devices.  </p>\n\n<p>If you ordered the ebook directly from Amazon, then Amazon would automatically download the file size appropriate for your device. But when you purchase the ebook directly from the publisher, you are buying essentially a file before it has been compressed by Amazon.com (that's why it is foolish to transfer the file via usb to your device). </p>\n\n<p>I am a big believer in buying the non-DRM file  from a publisher or Smashwords rather than buying it from Amazon.com, but if you do that, you need to upload it to your device. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, as someone who produces ebooks, producing .mobi files are a real pain in the neck --although I appreciate that Amazon now is sending you a file size according to what your device can handle. </p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> this article explains why mobi files tend to be so huge and why it doesn't matter for the end user. <a href=\"https://www.52novels.com/from-the-ebook-formatting-files-why-is-my-mobi-file-so-huge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.52novels.com/from-the-ebook-formatting-files-why-is-my-mobi-file-so-huge/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>FURTHER THOUGHTS:</strong> I occasionally have issues reading epub files with lots of graphics on Google Play Books or ibooks. Sometimes you're just going to have to live with the file size (especially if the graphics are a vital part of the content), but I trust O'reilly to do as much optimizing as possible.  Occasionally you have self-published ebooks by amateurs which make no effort to keep file size down. This raises an interesting question: what file size would be difficult to read on current devices and reading software? Generally, if the epub is over 25 MB, I have found it cumbersome to read on a tablet. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I am looking at the excellent book EPUB 3 BEST PRACTICES by Matt Garrish and Markus Grylling in the section \"Page Numbering.\" </p>\n\n<p>First, we need to describe what the function of the <code>&lt;nav epub:type=\"page-list\" ..&gt;</code> element is supposed to do. Some reading systems  (specifically Readium) have the ability to search specifically by page number (presumably printed page number). IN Garrish's book this feature is called  \"page jump functionality.\" </p>\n\n<p>Only if a reading system provides this functionality, then it would be helpful to include an ordered list within the nav \"page-list\" type. So nav epub.page-list is an optional method for providing an alternate navigation/search method. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> the only constraint on page-list type is that it must contain an ordered list. For this reason, the semantics for LI are interchangeable; there's no special requirements or constraints on the value. If the writers of the standard wanted to constrain the values of the ordered list items, they would have created an additional unique element with the nav page-list element.   </p>\n\n<p>So yes, these references are arbitrary -- you could use letters of the alphabet, Roman numerals; it does not matter. </p>\n\n<p>Later the book mentions providing anchors for page numbering. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span\n         epub:type=\"pagebreak\"\n         id=\"page24\"\n         title=\"24\"/&gt;\n   …\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Presumably for the example you used, you would switch <strong>id=page752</strong> on the georgia.xhtml page. </p>\n\n<p>(The book also describes the pros and cons of using css to show/hide these page indicators throughout the text). </p>\n\n<p>A few things worth noting: First, I don't even know which reading systems support this feature of search by page number. Second, I am skeptical about whether this is implemented on Kindles (I could be wrong...) Third, I suspect the ideal way  to implement references to printed pages is by letting a tool like Adobe Indesign auto-generate these things. </p>\n",

I could not even find that css in the epub3 support grid <a href=\"http://epubtest.org/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://epubtest.org/features/</a> (which may or may not mean something).  That sounds like the sort of thing which Google Play Books MIGHT support though I'd want  to verify. </p>\n\n<p>Second,  my method for producing epub accomplishes exactly  what you want.  I am using Docbook XML (and Docbook XSLT) to generate XHTML output which I then zip and validate. It's not an easy solution and it is very tricky, but Docbook has much more semantically rich elements and some powerful ways to style it. It includes various different methods for changing the numbering for sections (and even omitting the numbering). It also has different methods for chunking the output by chapter/section/subsection. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HtmlOutput.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HtmlOutput.html</a>\nUnfortunately documentation for producing epubs is not up to date. (In fact, it just occurred to me that I should write up a tutorial about my own process). </p>\n\n<p>While Docbook may require too much learning curve for your current task, its approach illustrates how to solve the problem in another way.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your specific need, I think it's perfectly valid to hardcode numbering into your sections -- even if it will be hard to maintain over time. Sometimes the dumb solution is still the best. You could use a media query to separate between reading systems that support the css and those that do not. (But that could be messy if you need to change the content and not just the presentation). </p>\n\n<p>This raises another question. Wouldn't you want the TOC to reflect the numbering as well? Yes, it's possible to have different levels in your TOC. The excellent book  Epub3 Best Practices by Matt Garish covers topics like that -- although it doesn't go into detail about css support -- which is still a moving target. (I suspect that Oreilly is also using Docbook behind their production process as well) \n<a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024897.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024897.do</a></p>\n",

Same goes for stuff I've read on the Kobo before through the same system.</p>\n\n<p>There is no hardware or software change on the Kobo whatsoever. It just was working one moment, and then suddenly not.</p>\n\n<p>How do I fix this?</p>\n",

The only thing that needs to happen is that the site where you get your pages from changes from providing whole pages to partial ones that read the rest of the content using JavaScript that the Kobo doesn't (correctly) interpret.</p>\n\n<p>You can check that the above is the case, by going to the pages with JavaScript switched off in your normal browser. The pages most likely will be incomplete.<br>\nIf this is indeed the case, a remedy is available, but not simple: you have to automatically retrieve the pages with a fully functional browser (with JavaScript turned on), wait until you assume the page is fully rendered (there is <strong>no</strong> way to be 100% sure about that) and then save the rendered page to a location on a server where you Kobo can read it. Once that is set up, update the URLs on your Kobo to the location where you save it.</p>\n\n<p>I have done such trickery with a Python program and selenium running on my headless server co-located in a data center where I can easily get at the saved material.

It is perfectly valid, for\n  example, to remove content from the default rendering and replace it\n  with an enhanced experience when scripting is available.

What you must avoid doing is scripting content such\n  that without the scripting the primary narrative is not available in\n  whole or part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Generally, it is helpful to think as a reading system as a stripped down version of a browser -- especially because it is assumed that an epub file needs to be readable over a longer period of time. </p>\n\n<p>It is hard to believe that there are circumstances that a browser window  on a mobile device would not be better than an epub file read by a mobile reading system. Even if you need to store and display data, a browser window or a special app is better suited for that. </p>\n\n<p>One of the essential problems is that the type of functionality you are looking for wouldn't be seen as an important priority for developers of reading systems. I'm guessing that for scripting the priorities are scripting support for quizzes, game, geolocation and things related to modifying the display or enhancing search -- not pulling in remote data.  </p>\n\n<p>My guess is that out of all the reading systems, the one most likely to support advanced scripting would be iBooks, so there might be some ibooks-specific solutions. </p>\n\n<p>A brief listing of device support for various scripting functions is here: <a href=\"http://epubtest.org/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://epubtest.org/features/</a> </p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. </p>\n",

All epub2 readers can view epub3 files -- though perhaps not optimally. </p>\n\n<p>My current book production method lets me show table headers across different pages, but only for printed books.

One idea is just to distribute it as a pdf instead of as an epub. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what I have learned: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>epub3 specification does not have any requirement for this kind of\nfeature. CSS does not appear to support it.</li>\n<li>You may find information about how to accomplish the same thing by\nchecking accessibility guidelines. Unsighted people need a way to\nnavigate complex tables, and ideally a solution to address this\nconcern will also address your concern. \n<a href=\"https://idpf.github.io/a11y-guidelines/content/xhtml/tables.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://idpf.github.io/a11y-guidelines/content/xhtml/tables.html</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tables are a problem that still need solving in reading systems, as most reading systems aren't able to provide extended horizontal or vertical scrolling to facilitate rendering. As a result, large tables get rendered in the available space – leaving rows and columns to spill across page views – compromising the quality of the ebook for sighted readers in trying to aid accessible devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Matt Garrish described this problem in his Epub3 Best Practices \n        book. As of 2013 (the time he wrote the book), there wasn't a real\n        solution. He suggested using the headers attribute, i.e.,  TD\n        headers=\"batting-averages\" to give extra information which an\n        assistive technology could highlight. He wrote,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There's also no reason why this functionality can't be equally useful to sighted readers, except that it's rarely made available. You've already seen the problem of visually rendering table data on small screens, and there's an obvious solution here to the problem a sighted reader will have of seeing perhaps only a few cells at a time and not having the visual context of what they're looking at. But whether mainstream devices begin taking advantage of this information to solve these problems remains to be seen. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From my own perspective, here are some possible ways to come close to solving the problem: 1)use CSS media queries to detect big vs. small devices and then change the styling accordingly. (maybe hide/reveal text?). 2)Use a fixed layout epub file rather than a responsive layout. (I don't recommend this, but it is a solution that works in kindle-land), 3)use typical clues to \"remind\" readers which columns go with what. For example, alternate columns can be colored, so it's easier for the reader to refer to headers on  a previous page. 4)You might be able to force page breaks with css and then simply create two separate tables with headings where the second table is a continuation of the first or 5)you might simply use redundant labels throughout the table to remind the reader what is what. 6)you might put a warning (best viewed on devices with resolution larger than .....) </p>\n\n<p>This is definitely a problem, and in my opinion, it needs to be solved by the specification first, and then the reading systems need to implement it. As I mentioned before, I believe this problem is an accessibility problem, so I would stay on top of the accessibility guidelines and the readers with the best support for accessibility. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>It's pretty straightforward: ebook is a generic word that encompasses many different digitalized formats for reading.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, that would make  a PDF a kind of ebook. But it all depends on how inclusive you want your definition of an ebook to be. I don't think there is any single definition. </p>\n\n<p>The main complaint about pdfs is that you can't edit PDF files easily (it's usually  an output format) and that you can't resize the text in a responsive manner (You can only zoom in and zoom out the entire page). That limited its usefulness in smaller devices. In contrast, the epub format and others made it easily to navigate through tables of contents and change text size and global styles. In terms of responsive design, epub was a more flexible format (and indeed, it was constructed precisely for that purpose). PDFs were designed to be viewed and printed in a single size. You can change  size to allow it to be displayed on a larger or smaller screen, but it still was built primarily for rendering in one size. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are lots of tools for producing pdf files (much more than EPUB), and now 9 inch and 10 inch mobile devices are able to view many different sizes without too much pain. Typically though, the pdf tools are office applications and don't allow you to manipulate source code or its styles.  </p>\n\n<p>Practically speaking, publishers don't create pdfs except for print copies because amazon doesn't sell pdf ebooks. (But amazon does support fixed layout ebooks, which is similar). But practically speaking, even nontechnical people have access to an application which can read pdf files. </p>\n\n<p>PDFs have been around forever -- and associated with Adobe -- though over time it has been accepted as an OpenFormat and an ISO standard (in contrast to MS Word, for example). </p>\n\n<p>An interesting question (and a frequent subject of debate) is whether ebooks should have embedded fonts or should have the option not to (and use the device's defaults). I might be wrong, but the PDF standard requires the font to be embedded -- which means requiring a fairly sophisticated tool to do this. (Epub just requires the ability to edit HTML). </p>\n",

When I place the magnet on the kindle again, the kindle displays the screen-saver rather than turning the screen off.</p>\n\n<p>From what I understand about e-ink technology the technology is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Ink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bi-stable</a> meaning the actual display of the image doesn't drain power, its the refresh of the page (as well as wifi, the back-light, touch response and the cpu processes). On the lowest brightness setting the kindle has an almost unnoticeable light source which can be seen in the dark as a glow. When I use the magnet and the screen-saver comes on, the light <em>appears</em> to shut off completely.</p>\n\n<p>That said, a number of sources on-line say this light stays on when the screen-saver is displayed which will still drain the battery over a long period of time. I don't think this to be true but I can't confirm it either. Is this true of the current gen model, older models or not?</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Piece of advice. When troubleshooting, I would make your output an epub file to make it easier to see what is wrong. An epub can be unzipped (you have to change the file extension --- so you can examine the resulting HTML files). You can always convert from epub to mobi later if you need to. </p>\n\n<p>First, when using calibre to create an epub/mobi from an odt file, it has to generate html files which when zipped or processed can have a toc. It  assumes that you have formatted your .odt file in a way which allows calibre to guess the chapter headings. For help, see: <a href=\"https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/conversion.html#table-of-contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/conversion.html#table-of-contents</a> Generally the safest thing to do is to use the h1 tag or to Heading 1 style within LibreOffice or MS Office; generally Calibre can detect that. (You may need to tweak the conversion settings from the Convert options ). </p>\n\n<p>A epub TOC can mean 2 different things in the context of a epub/kindle file: 1)an html page which appears at the front of the ebook or a 2)TOC when you press the TOC icon in the reading system. In your reading app, check the TOC icon to make sure that nothing appears when you press it. If it doesn't, then that is the source of your problem. </p>\n\n<p>(The first kind of html TOC  can be autogenerated using a Calibre conversion option: <strong>Force use of auto-generated TOC</strong>). </p>\n\n<p>There is a tab for MOBI OUTPUT/EPUB Output options in Calibre: make sure the right things are checked or unchecked: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not add TOC to book (make sure this is not checked!) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(generally the defaults are good, you shouldn't have to mess around with them). </p>\n\n<p>In my experience, generating epubs and mobis from calibre is often buggy. I find that using calibre to convert from docx is slightly better than to convert .odt. So you might try converting to docx just to see if it converts properly. </p>\n\n<p>The key thing though is making sure that the .odt/.docx file is properly formatted and styled. You have to use the STYLES provided by ODT/MS Office for the TOC to be created properly. You can't just manually style the headings. </p>\n\n<p>Hope this points you to a solution. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Thoughts:</strong> I think Calibre is a great application, but I would never rely on it for a published book (I run an indie ebook publishing company). </p>\n\n<p>Instead, you should create a high quality epub (by whatever means), and then use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765261\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kindle Previewer</a> to convert from epub to .mobi <strong>Important:</strong> Download the BETA version of this Kindle Previewer software -- the link is on the right side of that URL. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>To answer your last question, no it should not be necessary to contact support to receive an updated version of an ebook. If a kindle account has chosen to enable automatic updates, these updates should just show up. </p>\n\n<p>Whether the Kindle device does this reliably is a separate question of course. Let's try to troubleshoot the obvious things. Let me say that I use KDP a lot and have never had problems like you have suggested. </p>\n\n<p>Has your dad's account turned off automatic updating?  Possibly the problem is one with your dad's device; can you verify that it has Internet and can download other titles? Most devices have a SYNC button which can force a sync. </p>\n\n<p>You should also try to test this for other accounts/devices. You can do this by making an insignificant update on the title page. (maybe add an extra word or letter). Update that version and then you can download a sample of the ebook on another device and see what happens. </p>\n\n<p>The key thing is to establish whether it is happening to all accounts and all devices, or only your dad's account or only to one device of your dad's. That would seem relatively easy to do. </p>\n\n<p>You should also check to see if there are more than one versions of the same ebook on the same device. This has happened to me before. I will upload one version for testing, and then have alongside it a version available for sale. It may appear that the ebook has not been updated when all I have been doing is viewing an older version of a file which I uploaded earlier. </p>\n\n<p>One other thing. This may not apply to you, but often while testing ebooks I upload ebooks to a specific device using the Manage Personal Documents feature. If you are uploading a no DRM ebook (as opposed to downloading an ebook you have paid for), the device will process the ebook somewhat differently. Also, it can be easy to accidentally specifically a wrong device if the account had multiple devices associated with it. So for uploading Personal Documents (in this case ebooks), you should doublecheck whether you have chosen to send the updated file to the right device. </p>\n\n<p>(Hey, please let SE know what happens. I'm in the middle of updating 3 ebooks right now, and remain curious about where things messed up). </p>\n",

So it gives potential readers a different kind of medium which can justify the purchase decision. </p>\n\n<p>I have created one book trailer and am working on another. I have also studied other book trailers and have reached the conclusion that lowtech works best. Many of the book trailers seem way too polished and marketing-ish to convince me of anything. On the other hand, I have seen some book trailers in sci fi genre which definitely made the book more appealing to me. But sci fi is a special category, and the graphics/presentation for these book trailers were top-notch -- and expensive if you had to pay someone to do it. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, book trailers are fairly good at building an author brand. You could just have a 2-3 minute video of the author speaking about why he/she wrote the book. If the book is nonfiction, the author could talk about what led him or her to write the book (that is always interesting). Keep in mind that viewers tend to judge authors by appearances or  manner of talk or dress.  Some degree of mystery can be good for an author. </p>\n\n<p>Update: I just checked the youtube page for my 1st book trailer, and I see that in 2 years the video received 164 views. That's not a lot of payoff; on the other hand, a lot of self-help, business gurus do youtube videos to accompany their book and get a good number of hits -- especially if they are peddling practical knowledge. </p>\n",

For example making a website that promotes your work is not a bad idea!

Endnotes are way easier and more appropriate. </p>\n\n<p>The problem here is that HTML isn't semantically rich enough to do these things automatically. You need to manually do the numbering. </p>\n\n<p>I use docbook XML to create citations and endnotes. Very easy to do. Then I use docbook XSLT to output everything in clean HTML. That is a powerful solution, especially if you are comfortable using XSLT. <a href=\"http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/Footnotes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/Footnotes.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Another out of the box solution is to edit source in Markdown language and then convert everything to HTML. I see that Pandoc has a footnote solution <a href=\"http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#footnotes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#footnotes</a></p>\n\n<p>It would be worth looking into what capabilities Adobe Indesign has for creating footnotes/endnotes. They have an Export-to-epub capability, and maybe the output renders the footnotes/endnotes in a  nonsucky way. </p>\n\n<p>Failing that, regular expressions are the way to go. But you might look into this: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-idioms.html#footnotes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-idioms.html#footnotes</a></p>\n\n<p>At the risk of trying to simplify your need, a lot can be said for just doing it manually rather than trying to change your production process. This is true especially if you already know the number for each footnote -- like, are you just reproducing the footnote number from a public domain work? Maintaining under 100 citations manually might be less trouble than you think. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I do ebook conversions regularly. I can't answer every point in your question, but I can give you some general strategies. </p>\n\n<p>First, the Amazon mobi format is hard and tricky to make a good ebook for. Also, you need to do a lot of testing for it. Typically, publishers create something which looks good in .epub format and then use Kindle Previewer to convert it from epub to mobi. The Kindle Previewer is actually an excellent and reliable  tool <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1003018611\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1003018611</a> .</p>\n\n<p>Generally epub/mobi files look better if you start with HTML as your source instead of an Office program like MS Office or Adobe Indesign. Here's the Kindle formatting guide: <a href=\"https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I don't know about Korean text/font issues,but I'm guessing that if you create a valid epub file (and convert to mobi) and if you use an embedded font, it should probably render fine. But it will probably require a lot of time to test. </p>\n\n<p>Displaying tabular data can be hard for ebooks (even in English). It requires css media queries and sufficient testing. </p>\n\n<p>Another option is just to leave it as PDF and sell the PDF using a service other than Amazon (See this: <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Digital-Publishing-What-is-the-simplest-way-to-sell-single-PDFs-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.quora.com/Digital-Publishing-What-is-the-simplest-way-to-sell-single-PDFs-online</a>  You might use a service like Payloadz or Scribd to sell directly. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from dedicated ebook readers, many people who own tablets can read PDFs perfectly fine. They will typically use PDF apps or something like Google Play Books or Adobe Digital Editions which can read both. The main problem is that the text isn't reflowable (or not easily reflowable). But hyperlinks and fonts and tables generally appear on  readers just as it does when you edited it yourself. </p>\n\n<p>So the question becomes: is it worth the extra time,  money and aggravation to format and test an epub file for conversion to Kindle? Or can you live without having the ebook for sale on Amazon but being able to sell a perfectly formatted PDF  on another distribution service? With a PDF, you only need to proofread it; you won't need to spend time testing on various devices and screen dimensions. </p>\n",

I used an embedded font on my last ebook, and it did not render correctly on all devices (on kindle for example, it rendered on most systems, but not all). My guess is that more recent reading systems will support embedded fonts better, but you should always assume that a backup font could be used. </p>\n\n<p>Most reading systems offer a limited amount of fonts and allow the reader to override the publisher's specified fonts. In some reading systems, there is an option for the system to use publisher settings, but there is no guarantee that the reader will have checked this setting. </p>\n\n<p>My strategy has been to not specify fonts for the body text, but specify/embed fonts only when the element needs to be differentiated from the rest of the text. (Maybe it's a blockquote, a heading or a preface or title). </p>\n\n<p>I haven't tested ebooks in a while, but you might find it surprising to know that certain fonts don't display properly  when embedded on some reading systems while other fonts do. You can only determine this by testing on several different reading systems. </p>\n\n<p>When the user changes the font on the reading system, usually it's only for body and paragraphs; sometimes it's for paragraphs and headings. It depends on the reading system. Some reading systems (like Adobe Digital Editions on android) embed all the fonts and don't give readers any choices, while other reading systems let you choose from 20 or 30 different fonts.  This is insanity, don't you agree? </p>\n\n<p>As a publisher, it drives me crazy that a reader would switch fonts because of a  personal preference. I predict that eventually readers won't have the option to select font family -- only font size --, but I admit I really don't know what will be the future.  </p>\n",

Since epub and mobi are reflowable document formats, there is always a possibility that the device being used to view the document will push a text caption on the next page. However, devices do not usually split images across more than one page.</p>\n\n<p>While I have used the text-in-image solution in the past, I don't personally recommend it, since images can be displayed at many different sizes and resolutions depending on the device or screen. It may be difficult for readers to read the caption while viewing on their phone, but the caption may look unusually large compared to body text on a computer screen. People using an e-ink reader may find the image text grainy or difficult to read. I agree that it is undesirable for the caption to get orphaned from its image, but I think that most readers of ebooks are accustomed to these kinds of text-flow failures, and would prefer the text being on the next page over not being able to read the text at all.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to do the best you probably can, you could try wrapping your image and caption in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with <code>page-break-inside: avoid;</code> styling, but support for this CSS property is not universal, so you are still at the mercy of the device. </p>\n\n<p>Some people prefer to use <code>page-break-before: always;</code> before the image, but this also has drawbacks. (You can end up with only one or two lines of text on a page and then a forced page-break for the image.)</p>\n\n<p>In the event that all of the devices you plan to support can handle SVG tags, you could wrap the image in <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> and include the text caption inside the SVG tag with the image. I have heard this works very well (but it requires SVG support).</p>\n\n<p>If you're still interested in other more complicated ideas, you can check <a href=\"https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166836\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this thread on the MobileRead forums</a>.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Neither of the other answers are technically correct, so I will add mine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>eBook readers are computers and they run computer operating systems, so they are inherently vulnerable to exploitation, including viruses and trojans. (The same is true of routers, cable modems, DVRs, home security systems, automotive entertainment centers, smart refrigerators, etc.) Additionally, there are a lot of ways that malware could get onto your eReader that you have just plain never thought of. </p>\n\n<p>While it seems to be rare, some people have reported getting viruses on their eReaders, such as this individual <a href=\"http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/02/12/kindle-cant-catch-virus/#comment-1094357\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">whose kindle was apparently infected</a> with a virus that targets flash drives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caveat:</strong></p>\n\n<p>eReaders probably have low \"hack value\" to malware creators. Malware generally serves one of two purposes: obtaining money (for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ransomware</a> or <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/31/technology/swift-bank-hacks/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bank hacks</a>) or obtaining power (for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">botnets</a> used for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DDoS</a> attacks). When it comes to these two things, eReaders are probably pretty low on the list of targets for a variety of reasons. But you can never be sure. A year ago, no one would have guessed that the most effective botnet to date would run on infected DVRs and cable modems. But then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mirai</a> happened.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longer answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few ways your eReader could be infected with a virus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Multimedia files (like images, movies, and sound) are all binary file formats, which means they need to be interpreted by software on the device before they can be displayed. All multimedia file interpreters could potentially have vulnerabilities. Android in particular has been found over the past few years to have many (for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stagefright</a>). These vulnerabilities have been patched in newer versions of Android, but chances are that your 4-or-more-year-old Android-based eReader hasn't received any security updates since you bought it.</li>\n<li>MOBI/AZW/KF8 are binary formats that rely on interpreters to read them. If someone were to reverse engineer those interpreters and find a vulnerability, they could craft a malicious eBook to compromise vulnerable devices. The same is true for EPUB (which uses zip compression, a binary file format).</li>\n<li>PDF is an executable binary format. If you have ever gotten spam email with a PDF attached, it was almost certainly a maliciously crafted file that exploits a known vulnerability in some version of Adobe Reader. In the same way a PDF attachment in your email can infect your computer, a PDF file could be specially crafted to exploit a vulnerability in an eReader or its OS, and opening the file would infect your device.</li>\n<li>If your eReader is network connected (over wifi, 3g, etc.) it can been seen by other devices on the same network, and could be accessed if any ports on the device are open by default (which is a possibility) or if there is a vulnerability in any of the device's network protocol handlers. Therefore, a malicious agent inside your network (such as some other infected device) could potentially compromise your eReader.</li>\n<li>Your eReader could potentially be exposed to the wider internet if it was poorly designed (for example, if the operating system is opening ports on the router via universal plug-and-play... but hopefully you've turned off UPnP in your router's admin panel anyway). If this is the case, it could become infected with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mirai</a>-like worm if someone were to decide to target that type of device.</li>\n<li>Your eReader almost certainly has a USB port that you use for charging and transferring files. Operating systems inherently trust USB devices that are plugged into them, and this can lead to all sorts of problems if a malicious USB device is plugged in (see <a href=\"https://samy.pl/poisontap/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PoisonTap</a> or <a href=\"http://usbrubberducky.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rubber Ducky</a> for examples). (Edit: Apparently some peoples' eReaders are <a href=\"http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/02/12/kindle-cant-catch-virus/#comment-1094357\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">being infected over USB</a> like this.)</li>\n<li>If all that isn't bad enough, it's possible that some eReaders already have malware on them that was installed in the factory in China (like happened with <a href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/android-malware-china-huawei-zte-kryptowire-blu-products/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">over 700 million Android smartphones</a>). Or the manufacturer could have deliberately included a backdoor (like happened with <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/3147311/security/backdoor-accounts-found-in-80-sony-ip-security-camera-models.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">over 80 models of Sony webcams</a>).</li>\n<li>If your eReader has a web browser, it is a potential vector for infection.</li>\n<li>If your eReader supports javascript or poorly implements certain HTML5 features, those are possible vectors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are other ways that I'm just not thinking of right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's probably better not to think about it too hard. You could end up paranoid.</p>\n",

This is particularly true when there's a lot of text for the reader to process. Setting the text of a book in a fonts with potential for slowing down reading speed is going to hamper readability.

Knowing that will help you, whether you want to blend in and let the words do the talking, or stand out from your peers with a page that has a different feel. </p>\n\n<p>Readability is a large area to explore. There are many studies and articles on which fonts are most readable, but the conventional wisdom (which has often been questioned) is that serif fonts are best for body type. Sans-serif fonts are often used to set off headlines and titles. Using no more than two fonts on a page is a good rule of thumb; without real knowledge of how fonts work together, using more than that looks chaotic and amateurish. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>The US government has given Bowker a sort of protected monopoly on ISBNs, so Bowker is the only authorized top-level distributor of ISBNs in the US. </p>\n\n<p>Some companies have negotiated redistribution rights with Bowker, so they buy ISBNs in bulk and resell them at prices lower than what Bowker charges for their self-publishing packages. For example, Amazon Createspace sells a single ISBN to publishers who use their platform at a lower price than Bowker would charge for a single number.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like the site you linked to is buying ISBNs under the imprint name of \"Independent Publisher\" and reselling them. Here are a few things to consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When you buy from Bowker you control your ISBN record directly and can make changes by yourself if necessary. If you buy from a reseller, you will have to request that they make changes for you and trust them to follow through.</li>\n<li>When you buy from Bowker you can use your company name as the imprint name, if that matters to you. If you buy from a reseller, their imprint name will be listed on the record, whatever that may be (\"Independent Publisher\" in this case).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reseller you linked to is being a bit deceptive in their wording. The recommendation is that you use a separate ISBN for each format, not each platform. So EPUB needs a different number from MOBI/KF8, and PDF needs yet another number, but your EPUB can use the same ISBN on iBooks, Nook, Kobo, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Giving your ebook an ISBN allows distributors to report sales statistics about your ebook to industry lists. I'm not aware of much other practical benefit that an ISBN provides, as none of the major distribution channels require them. Personally, I currently only use ISBNs on print books.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I found the answer to this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/27091873/5075214\">on stackoverflow</a>. You can target different iBooks reading modes using these special CSS selectors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:root[__ibooks_internal_theme*=\"Sepia\"]\n:root[__ibooks_internal_theme*=\"Gray\"]\n:root[__ibooks_internal_theme*=\"Night\"]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's an example. I was using an <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> below my chapter heading. I set the color to black, but in Night mode it disappears on the black background. This CSS changes the color to match the text when Night mode is active:</p>\n\n<pre><code>hr {\n  border: 0;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n:root[__ibooks_internal_theme*=\"Night\"] hr {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid #b0b0b0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Used appropriately, this is super useful for getting your decorative elements to show up in Night/Gray modes or for retaining syntax highlighting in a programming book while in Night/Gray mode. However, as others have said on stackoverflow and at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/adaptivegarage/aef95223fab9a39db45f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the github page with sample code</a>, this is not a method that Apple has officially sanctioned, so remember not to abuse it or they could start blocking it.</p>\n\n<p>For reference, here are the default text and background colors for all four themes (obtained from screenshots of iBooks on my iPhone 6):</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"White\"\n    color: #000000;\n    background-color: #fbfbfb;\n\"Sepia\"\n    color: #000000;\n    background-color: #f8f1e3;\n\"Gray\"\n    color: #c9caca;\n    background-color: #5a5a5c;\n\"Night\"\n    color: #b0b0b0;\n    background-color: #121212;\n</code></pre>\n",

I can't imagine a case where the inverted colors would represent a problem (unless maybe you were using a third font color that was in between or you were coloring some background?) </p>\n\n<p>It's certainly important to test night mode. I also encountered an issue with some images I used in my heading. The images themselves had white background (or near white background) and looked less than ideal in night mode. Also, I discovered that it wasn't scaling to full width as I had thought. If you are using a transparent image, you'd want to make sure that there were enough contrasts with a darkened background. Or maybe specifying a background color would make sure that it is inverted in night mode. </p>\n\n<p>But I think readers expect that night mode might make a few things look funny. </p>\n",

You can put a note on the book description that the ebook is best when viewed on a 9 inch tablet or something like that. </p>\n\n<p>For Amazon books, my rule of thumb has been to upload the maximum resolution image into the ebook because Amazon will downsize the image automatically according to the type and size of device. Downsizing images is unnecessary for kindles. </p>\n\n<p>Another idea (regardless of whether you do images or HTML tables) is to use CSS to force a page break and then render the table or image in landscape mode using the css. A lot of tables tend to be wider than taller, and I think readers are comfortable for viewing tables in landscape mode. </p>\n",

MS Office will probably specify its own font, and then Kindle won't support it or allow it to be embedded.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a better strategy. Focus on producing an epub file which validates as EPUB 3 <a href=\"http://validator.idpf.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://validator.idpf.org/</a> If it validates, my guess is that it will also render easily on Kindle if you convert from epub to Kindle using Kindle Beta Previewer. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1003018611\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1003018611</a></p>\n\n<p>The work processes (and the necessary steps) for producing a kindle/epub file are a lot different for creating a Createspace printed book. What works in Createspace will probably not work for Kindle and vice versa. </p>\n\n<p>To produce a good epub/kindle file, you should probably create the content using an HTML/epub editor. Try using either of these two (free) products: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Calibre's EPUB editor (which is different from the Calibre\nconversion part).

If you have heard that they do, then it should be easy. </p>\n\n<p>If not, then you will have to embed a special Malayam font yourself. This is not extremely difficult, but it is complicated.

An alternative, always from Google, is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_fonts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Droid</a> family, from which Noto is partly derived.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Liberation</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Libertine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Linux Libertine/Biolinum</a> families are specifically designed to be a free and open substitute to Windows standard fonts such as Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DejaVu_fonts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DejaVu</a>, similarly, is a fairly complete set of fonts that is installed by default on many of the main Linux distributions.</p></li>\n<li><p>As Nemo XXX suggested, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charis_SIL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Charis SIL</a> is a good and fairly complete font (and, if you ask me, also more distinctive and better looking that the old plain and kinda boring Times New Roman). Another option, always from SIL International, is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentium\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gentium</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>(2017-06-22 EDIT)</em> <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Martel</a> and <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Martel+Sans\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Martel Sans</a> fonts are specifically designed to cover Latin and Devangari characters.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not really familiar with Devangari (or any other non-latin) script, so you should check these alternatives yourself and see if they suit your needs. I can't guarantee that all the fonts that I've listed include the characters that you need to display, I've just pointed out some of the major open source font projects, I leave it to you to make your tests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the samples:</strong> I've tried to open both the ePub and PDF that you have provided, they are BOTH displayed with latin characters, even the non-english text.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>1) Please note that I'm not a lawyer and I'm just saying this out of common sense, do your research accordingly.</em></p>\n",

    "body": "<p>What you want to accomplish is not a quick and easy task. You need to capture images of the book pages, clean the images, and depending on your desire, convert them to text, format them, and generate files in your desired format. <strong>I agree with idiotprogrammer and the others in the comments: if you can already buy an ebook version or find a (legal) free copy online, you are much better off doing that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That said, if you still want to scan in your books, here is are the basics to get you started:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Decide what you want</h2>\n\n<p>Creating your own ebooks with searchable, reflowable text (changes to fit screen) and table of contents is a complicated process and it really helps if you are good with computers.</p>\n\n<p>Creating PDF files out of scanned book images is pretty easy, and it will accomplish your basic goal. However, you won't be able to search the text or highlight things, and the text won't reflow to fit your device's screen. I would highly recommend you choose this route if you're only concerned about being able to read your books.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Scan the book</h2>\n\n<p>The quickest way to capture \"scans\" of book pages is with a camera, but you will need some sort of rig that holds the book and camera in a fixed position. You might start by looking at some of the ideas at <a href=\"https://www.diybookscanner.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diybookscanner.org</a>. The forum there has a lot of great info. (I personally own an Archivist Quill, but I'm not telling you to spend that kind of money)</p>\n\n<p>If you have a smartphone and a little bit of handiness, you might try making something like <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/04/04/home-made-book-scanner-uses-iphone-scans-24-pages-per-minute/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this iPhone book scanner</a> as a start.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a flatbed scanner, you could also use that, it's just rather slow, especially if you're capturing full color scans (voice of experience).</p>\n\n<p>Scanners capture pretty accurate images, but images captured with a camera will be slightly keystoned, so if that bothers you, you might want to try to find a dekeystoning script.  I use one I found on the diybookscanner forums.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Clean the images</h2>\n\n<p>Use a program like <a href=\"http://scantailor.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ScanTailor</a> to clean up the images.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to remove the page color and darken up the text, I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the GIMP</a> on your ScanTailor output files. Either the \"Colors > Levels\" or \"Colors > Curves\" tool would work well for this. Altering the images one at a time would be a huge task, so figure out the adjustments you want to make and then use the <a href=\"http://registry.gimp.org/node/26259\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BIMP for GIMP plugin</a> to batch apply them.</p>\n\n<h2>4a. Generate a PDF</h2>\n\n<p>If you choose the easy route, this is the last step. Use a program of your choice to convert your image files to a pdf. I do this with <a href=\"https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">imagemagick</a>, but imagemagick is a command line tool, so depending on your computer know-how you might want to look for a better option for you.</p>\n\n<h2>4b. OCR the images</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to create \"proper\" ebooks out of your scanned images, you will need to run the cleaned images through an OCR program.  <a href=\"https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tesseract</a> is a really good free tool to do this, but once again it is a command line tool.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Proofread and correct the text outputs</h2>\n\n<p><strong>This step is really time-consuming.</strong> In this step you will read the entire book very carefully looking for \"scannos\" (typographical errors made by the OCR software as it converted the images to text). If you don't do this, your ebook will be full of errors. </p>\n\n<h2>6. Create the ePub file</h2>\n\n<p><strong>This step can be rather complicated.</strong> Use a tool like <a href=\"https://sigil-ebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sigil</a> or <a href=\"https://calibre-ebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Calibre</a> to make your text files into an ePub. Sigil is a great tool, and I've used it quite a lot. Unless you are an experienced HTML programmer, it would probably be best if you try to avoid anything other than the basic formatting options the program makes available to you.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Convert your ePub to KF8</h2>\n\n<p>You can use Calibre for this, but I'd recommend using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kindlegen</a>, Amazon's official conversion tool. Once again, a command line tool.</p>\n",

In epub3 you can create a navigation page and hide all the entries in that TOC. </p>\n\n<p>Let me explain some basics. The terminology can be confusing because initially Kindle required a \"logical TOC\" (which was an HTML file linking to all the chapters) in addition to a TOC in toc.ncx  The real TOC (which is machine-readable) was in toc.ncx for epub2  but inside the NAV element of the <strong>required</strong> navigation document in epub3. </p>\n\n<p>In epub3 it is no longer necessary to have a toc.ncx file (and for future versions it will be deprecated). Instead you include a HTML navigation document (which you mark by using the NAV  element in that file). For epub3, writers of the standards wised up; they realized that rather than requiring two different kinds of TOCs, why not just put everything in one navigation HTML document, with proper tagging and then forget about toc.ncx? </p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, it is relatively easy to hide TOC entries inside the NAV element of the epub3 navigation document. </p>\n\n<p>Here's how you do it in epub3.  \"The presence of the <strong>hidden</strong> attribute on the root indicates that the entire list is excluded from rendering in the content flow.\" (<a href=\"http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-hidden\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"toc-title\"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;nav epub:type=\"toc\"&gt;\n           &lt;ol hidden=\"\"&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"editor-preface.xhtml\"&gt;Preface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"requiem.xhtml\"&gt; Requiem on the Rappahannock &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"version-history.xhtml\"&gt;Version History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;/ol&gt;\n    &lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not 100% sure you can hide all the entries (I haven't tested that), but I'm pretty sure you can hide almost all the entries (maybe you are required to have at least 1 visible TOC item). </p>\n\n<p>If you want to hide one or more entries in epub2, edit this in <strong>package.opf</strong>.</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;spine toc=\"ncx\"&gt;\n        &lt;itemref idref=\"cover\" linear=\"no\"/&gt;\n        &lt;itemref idref=\"htmltoc\" linear=\"yes\"/&gt;\n        &lt;itemref idref=\"alternate-toc\" linear=\"no\"/&gt; \n         ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Linear=\"no\"</strong> means to exclude it from the TOC entries for epub2 reading systems. Importantly, note that if you have an epub3 file, the reading system will probably obey the  and ignore whatever you put in the <strong>package.opf</strong> file. </p>\n\n<p>I am talking about epub and epub3. If I remember correctly, converting from epub3 to mobi produces the same effect. </p>\n\n<p>The ability to hide TOC entries is important for certain kinds of books (the first thing that comes to mind are Choose-your-own adventure ebooks and other hypertexts). </p>\n",

    "body": "<h2><strong>A download checker for <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/books\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Humble Bundle</a> book bundles.</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Since there seems to be no answer from this community regarding an application meeting the request in my question, I decided to make one myself.</p>\n\n<p>When you buy a bundle from Humble Bundle, whether books or games, they send you a web link to a HTML page (which I call here the <em>download page</em>).. You can then click on various buttons on the page to download the files composing your bundle. This page can also display on request the MD5 checksums (or signatures) for each of the files, which may be very large for comics and audio-books (and for games).</p>\n\n<p>I wish to check mechanically with a single command that all files have been downloaded, and that the MD5 signature of downloaded files is identical to the MD5 signature specified in the download page provided by Humble Bundle.</p>\n\n<p>The next section describes the rather simple script wrote to achieve my purpose. Given the doubts expressed in <a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/7221/how-to-check-easily-md5-signatures-for-humble-bundle-ebooks#comment4603_7221\">a comment to my initial question</a>, it is worth noting that, while applying this script to my own purchases from Humble Bundle, both to check my downloads and to debug the script, I discovered a variety of problems, some related to mixed up MD5 specifications\n(not really critical) and others related to various problems that must have occurred during download, that actually required action on my part. So the work was worth my effort.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, this program is doing thing that were not initially intended by its author.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The download checker</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The obvious first step is to have a command that will extract from the HTML source of the download page the names of the files together with the corresponding MD5. Here is such a command which is called <code>humblemd5</code>. It takes a single argument which is a file containing the HTML source code of the download page. This HTML source code can be downloaded with your browser.\nThe output is the list of names of the files to be dowloaded, each preceded by its MD5 signature. This is the standard format of the Linux command <code>md5sum</code> for computing the MD5 of a bunch of files, probably chosen for readability reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Here is such a command written in Perl, developed on Linux, but hopefully working on other platforms. I have also a version written in Linux command line language BASH, since <a href=\"https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/7221/how-to-check-easily-md5-signatures-for-humble-bundle-ebooks/7226#comment4621_7226\">some users seem to have a liking for the command line</a>, which I can add if requested.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl\n# USAGE:  humblemd5 &lt;local download page&gt;\n\n# Attribution : This code was written by Babou and is licensed as\n#               Creative Commons By-SA or GNU GPL. Live long and prosper.\n\n# This script \"humblemd5\" is intended to extract MD5 signatures of\n# Humble-Bundle files books to be downloaded, from the HTML download page\n# that provides the hyperlinks to the files.\n\n# The only argument &lt;local download page&gt; is the path to a local copy\n# of the download page.\n# The standard output contains one line for each file, containing\n# first the MD5 signature, followed by 2 spaces, followed by the file name.\n\n# This is the format used by the command \"md5sum\" in Linux (probably\n# also in other Unices).\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nmy $file= $ARGV[0];\n\nmy $pattmd5='^ *(&lt;/div&gt;)?&lt;div data-order-gamekey=\".*\"\" data-md5=\"(.{32})\"&gt;$';\n\nmy $pattname='^      &lt;a class=\"a\" (download=\"\" )?href=\"https://dl.humble.com/(.*)[?]gamekey=.*\" data-web=\"https://dl.humble.com/\\2[?]gamekey=.*$';\n\nmy $md5sig;\n\nopen my $fh, '&lt;', $file or die \"unable to open file '$file' for reading : $!\";\nwhile(my $line=&lt;$fh&gt;) {\n    if ($line =~ s/$pattmd5/${2}/) {\n      $md5sig = $line;\n      chomp $md5sig\n    } elsif ($line =~ s/$pattname/$2/) {\n      print  $md5sig.'  '.$line\n    }\n}\nclose($fh);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next step is to compute the MD5 signature of all downloaded files and check that they correspond to the list of names and md5 computed by this <code>humblemd5</code> command from the download page.</p>\n\n<p>The proper Unix/Linux way would be to have a standard command that checks whether a given bunch of files meet a specification defined by a list of file names preceded by MD5 signatures. I do not know whether such a command exists. Combined with the previous command, it would solve my question.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, since the local topic is not programming but ebooks, I designed a command <code>humblecheck</code> that can be used directly to check downloads. This command is written in the BASH command language of Linux, which I think runs only on Unix systems. The reason is that my knowledge of Perl is getting very rusty, and that I am not sure I could write properly in a system independent way, given that I have no Windows or Mac for testing.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the use of this command <code>humblecheck</code> is self explanatory. Its first argument is the download page, as for the previous command, and the second argument is the name of a directory supposed to contain the downloaded files.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n# USAGE: humblecheck &lt;local download page&gt; &lt;books directory&gt;\n\n# Attribution : This code was written by Babou and is licensed as\n#               Creative Commons By-SA or GNU GPL.

This\ngives you a bunch of files, including a file README_encrypted.txt\nwhich says it uses a key from the National Library Service, and point\nto the files <a href=\"http://openlibrary.org/help/faq/accessing#what-is-daisy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://openlibrary.org/help/faq/accessing#what-is-daisy</a>\nand <a href=\"https://nlsbard.loc.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://nlsbard.loc.gov/</a> for more explanation.</p>\n\n<p>They explain that the program (for modern books, hence under\ncopyright) is reserved to residents of the USA and\nAmerican citizens living overseas. I am not quite sure how they do\nthat legally, though they clearly enforce that with the DRM key.</p>\n\n<p>Some countries do have laws that make a copyright exception to the\nbenefit of disabled people within the country. I am not sure whether\nthat is the case in the USA, but it would be the simplest\nexplanation. However it does not explain giving access to American\ncitizens in other countries, since international treaties give the USA\njurisdiction on copyright only within the USA.</p>\n\n<p>Now if your country of residence has a similar law (free access for\ndisabled people) then it is possible that the National Library Service\nwould accept to give you a key to be used from your country, since\nthat would not raise any copyright infringement issue (though they might want to have an official agreement between countries). Maybe you\ncan try to discuss that with the people at info@archive.org, or the people\nat NLS. And you shold check the copyright law in your own country\nregarding exceptions for disabled people.</p>\n\n<p>This is just my best understanding, and all the suggestions I can give to solve your problem, and I am not a lawyer.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I am creating an ebook. I'm making the epub in Sigil, and then converting it to mobi in Calibre. Not that it matters, but I'm working on Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>I have endnotes set up as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the chapters, I have [x] as both an anchor and a link where x is a number. Each chapter is in its own xhtml file.</li>\n<li>The endnotes are all collected in an xhtml file at the end. Each endnote starts with [x] which is also both an anchor and a link.</li>\n<li>Thus, if you click on a number in the chapter it is linked to the end note and vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More detail: Something like this: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reference in chapter: <code>&lt;p id=\"ch01-01\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"../Text/Endnote.html#en01-01\"&gt;[1]&lt;\\a&gt;&lt;\\p&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Reference in endnote: <code>&lt;p id=\"en01-01\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"../Text/Ch01#ch01-01\"&gt;[1]&lt;\\a&gt;&lt;\\p&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The endnotes are structured like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Chapter 1 (a heading linked back to the chapter xhtml)</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>[1] endnote 1, linked back to the chapter 1 reference 1</p>\n  \n  <p>[2] endnote 2, linked back to the chapter 1 reference 2</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>[1] endnote 1, linked back to chapter 2 reference 1.</p>\n  \n  <p>Etc</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This all works well except for one thing. </p>\n\n<p>When I convert it into a Kindle book, it very helpfully makes a pop-up preview of the endnote, with an option to go visit the end notes. This is the hoped for behavior.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I click on the final endnote in a chapter, it does not accurately discern where the endnote ends. So the preview has the endnote and then runs over with more from the endnotes, such as the next chapter heading and sometimes even the first few endnotes from the next chapter. </p>\n\n<p>How does the Kindle footnote previewer know that the footnote has ended? Is there a way to pass it a false signal? For example, it would be possible to put in an empty footnote with just the anchors and links. But I wondered if there was a cleaner or more correct way (and if that would even work, though intuitively it should).</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I am putting together a puzzle book. In fact, I have been able to get the book organized into a valid <code>.epub</code> format. However, when I go to view the book on Amazon's Kindle Preview, the layout is less than desirable on the \"Phone\" and \"Kindle e-Reader\" options. The content shows fine when I view it through a web browser or if I open it through Google Play from a variety of tablets or if I view it on Kindle Preview's Tablet view --- and that was how I had tested it.</p>\n\n<p>The dilemma is this. The puzzle book format in order for it to make sense needs to have certain elements together. The general layout each page is this (pretend there's a stylesheet somewhere and there are <code>div</code>s in various spots)</p>\n\n<pre>\n<h1>Puzzle #</h1>\n<h2>Puzzle Goal</h2>\n<h3>Number of Possible Solutions (with link to solution page)</h3>\n\nPuzzle Image HERE\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>I need for the image to not get tossed on to the next \"page\" (another swipe). I want each puzzle to be self-contained on one screen regardless of the device. I've tried to have the image auto resize, but this behavior isn't always reliable and if the user chooses a different font setting, auto resizing is irrelevant since the image will simply be too big.</p>\n\n<p>I did some digging around on Amazon's website and found this\n<a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/A1WQ3CZGEVWE1V\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/A1WQ3CZGEVWE1V</a> which effectively says that if you have a book that is image heavy then you want a fixed layout file format.</p>\n\n<p>So I read Amazon's Kindle Publishing Guidelines: <a href=\"http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonKindlePublishingGuidelines.pdf</a> to see what it would take to get everything converted to fixed layout file format. From what I gathered, every page has to be its own separate HTML file, with its own stylesheet. I have 100 puzzles, with accompanying solutions making this effectively a 200+ page book (intended).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, my questions are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is the fixed layout file format, the only way to achieve what I'm after (without making the entire page itself an image)?</li>\n<li>Is it true that I <em>have</em> to have a separate stylesheet for each page for fixed layout file format? If so, why?</li>\n<li>Can I have &lt;a&gt; tags in a fixed layout book? (so that I can link to a puzzle's solution and also have a link from the solution back to the original puzzle, among other things)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I ask these questions because this looks like a considerable amount of work and if there are alternative methods in a reflowable way that aren't too much work, I'd rather that. Or if you happen to know some way of taking an existing .epub file which looks as desired in a .pdf [one puzzle on each page] and converting that to fixed layout, I would greatly appreciate a point in the right direction for how to do that.</p>\n",

I think someone with a moderate amount of experience on reflowables could do a reflowable version provided that readers were informed to use a minimum screen resolution (768 pixels width?) and not  use devices older than K4. </p>\n\n<p>Fyi there is an issue with  Google Play Books which does not honor this bit of code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>img {\npage-break-after: always !important;   \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That makes it impossible to do a page break using css alone in Google Play Books. I'm pretty sure this code works on Kindle devices and other reading systems though. </p>\n\n<p>For a reflowable book, you probably could use css media queries to ensure that each display size works on Kindle. The css breakpoints I use are 320-767px width (both portrait and landscape), 768-1500 (landscape), 1500+ (landscape), 768-1024 (portrait) and 1025+ (portrait). You should use high resolution images and then let Kindle downsize them when needed. Each css media query should specify a different size for the div container which contains the image. </p>\n\n<p>On Kindle the css max-width isn't supported, so I use the code here: <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/community/thread.jspa?messageID=1005910\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://kdp.amazon.com/community/thread.jspa?messageID=1005910</a></p>\n\n<p>If you do reflowable, you could declare that ebook is only for tablets and not for phones (that's the easiest thing!). For smaller screens you could split the content into 2 screens, but it wouldn't be optimal. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of testing would be involved, but it wouldn't be impossible. </p>\n",

Those should be available for Windows as well (<a href=\"http://djvu.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://djvu.sourceforge.net/</a>, make sure the executables are in your PATH) That metadata includes the DPI information from the file. Actual changing of the XML is fast, but extracting and merging takes a long (several minutes) time.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have a copy of your book, in case the merging breaks something, and run <code>python program.py book.djvu</code> on this <code>program.py</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import sys\nimport subprocess\n\nbook = sys.argv[1]\nxml_in = 'in.xml'\nxml_out = 'out.xml'\n\nprint('extracting XML')\nsubprocess.check_output(['djvutoxml', book, xml_in])\n\nprint('converting XML')\nwith open(xml_in) as inf:\n    with open(xml_out, 'w') as outf:\n        for line in inf:\n            if line.startswith('&lt;PARAM name=\"DPI\" value=\"96\" /&gt;'):\n                line = line.replace('96', '600')\n            outf.write(line)\nprint('merging XML')\nsubprocess.check_output(['djvuxmlparser', '-o', book, xml_out])\n\nprint('done')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In general I am against parsing XML without a real parser, but you don't need regex or anything that easily breaks to get this information fixed. </p>\n\n<p>The intermediate XML (two files) has the same order of size as the DjVu file itself, although the XML has no image information, it is just inefficient. Make sure you have enough room (and run this program on a fast/local drive)</p>\n\n<p>There are 367 incorrect pages out of 1201, you might be able to speed up the process by only including the incorrect pages in the output XML, but then you should use an XML parser. If this is a one off conversion, I would not bother with such an optimisation.</p>\n",

You will think you’re breaking the Kindle, but as long as you apply only\n  gentle force, you won’t actually break anything.</li>\n  <li>Remove the metal back panel. With a Phillips #0 screwdriver, remove the two screws which attach the metal back panel to the\n  Kindle’s plastic body, then slide the panel away. Until you replace\n  the back panels, keep a close eye on the volume rocker. Without the\n  back panels to hold it into position, it may fall out.</li>\n  <li>Remove the old battery. With a Phillips #0 screwdriver, remove the two screws holding the battery in place, then lift the battery out by\n  its black tabs.</li>\n  <li>Install the new battery. Drop it in connector first, then replace the two retaining screws.</li>\n  <li>Replace the metal back panel. Place it such that the panel lies flat and the volume rocker is held in place, then replace the two\n  retaining screws.</li>\n  <li>Replace the plastic back panel.

At the same time, you want the image to act like an inline element -- adjusting to the display. </p>\n\n<p>A block element by definition cannot switch order  with other elements depending on the display. In other words, you have to change the semantics to get what you want. But you still are not changing the order of elements. </p>\n\n<p>One thought is that you could use CSS media queries to conditionally change the img or div elements from block display to inline display depending on the device's screen dimensions.  That might help if you could boil your use cases to maybe two or three display sizes. </p>\n\n<p>I am not a css expert, so I'd love to hear if there is a way that works. But my guess is currently no, and even if a method exists, it probably won't be supported on Kindles anytime soon. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know much about Latex, but it can perform these conditional tricks because you are dealing with a fixed display size. With ebooks you are dealing with an endless variety of display sizes and devices. </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I'm having second thoughts about the answer. CSS has some new mechanisms like flexbox and grid formatting to deal with these cases. I could easily see a time in the next 5 years where ebook readers can deal with positioning of an image on a fixed point in the page. <a href=\"http://epubsecrets.com/easy-css-wins.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jimmy Panoz pointed out</a> that because reading systems use browser rendering systems, eventually reading systems will allow you to use  CSS Feature Queries to try CSS  experimental features.  </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I left a Kindle Paperwhite with my mom a month ago and it disappeared in the house, probably in between books somewhere. I know it still connects to wifi and receives documents through the kindle email at least once a day, so it has some battery left.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any call home, lost beep, or similar feature I could use to help focus the search?</p>\n\n<p>At worst I thought of setting up some laptops/phones sniffing packages and broadcast strength coming from the kindle's mac address (it shows up every once in a while in the router logs) and triangulate that to have a gross estimation of the location. Any idea on which software would be the most appropriate for it (ideally for ubuntu/android/windows)?\nThank you for your answers before the battery runs out</p>\n\n<p>[edit]<br>\nFound the Kindle using the sniffing technique described below. However I'd still like to know if there's a way to find it that's less overkill.</p>\n\n<p>I discovered that the Kindle updates its contents daily while in deep sleep around 5:30-6:30AM. So I set up the delivery of a biggish pdf file through the kindle email so I'd ensure a long enough connection, end set up three laptops with a Kali Linux running live with airodump sniffing packages (modified from here: <a href=\"http://www.androidauthority.com/capture-data-open-wi-fi-726356/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.androidauthority.com/capture-data-open-wi-fi-726356/</a>  )</p>\n\n<p>The following procedure can be used to physically find any active wifi device connected to a network:</p>\n\n<p>Three lines of code in the terminal in at least three Kali Linux running devices (2D location, at least 4 receivers out of plane for 3D):<br>\nTo start monitor mode on a wifi card (in this case wlan0, check on iwconfig if needed):<br>\nairmon-ng start wlan0<br>\nAirmon usually changes the card name to wlan[n]mon after this. Check the wifi interface name on iwconfig and modify accordingly if the next line returns a related error.<br>\nThen run airodump to find your wifi network and its channel:<br>\nairodump-ng wlan0mon<br>\nEnter Ctrl-C to end the capture once you note the desired network's channel\nRun the following line to run airodump again only at the specified channel and record the data to the \"allthedata.csv\" file in the terminal directory (usually the root for a live cd/usb if you didn't change it). Replace the square brackets by the channel number:<br>\nairodump-ng -c [channel number 1, 6 or 11 usually] -w allthedata wlan0mon</p>\n\n<p>I started the pcs before going to sleep and as I woke up a bit past the usual update time, I hit ctrl-C to stop the capture and looked up the device on the allthedata.csv files by its MAC number which can be obtained at the router logs. There are in fact 4 allthedata files with different extensions per capture, and on the xml you can find the manufacturer of the device in the logs, so even if you don't know the mac address by looking up an Amazon branded device connected to your router you may find the Kindle entry.</p>\n\n<p>At the Kindle entry, find the signal strength value and note it for all the receiver computers.\nThan convert the values from dbm to mW using the following formula: mW=10^(dBm/10)*1000.</p>\n\n<p>To triangulate the signal (for a 2D location), draw a chart with the position of the laptop wifi receivers and for every pair of receivers, draw a line perpendicular to the line going through the points in a point inversely proportional to the square root of the mW power values, as the signal drops of proportionally to the square of the distance (for 3D use at least 4 receivers and a surface between the points).</p>\n\n<p>The lines should cross at the source of the emission - the Kindle was at a closet in this case. The margin of error was about 1m/3ft even with several concrete/brick walls in between the receivers and the emission.</p>\n\n<p>[edit 2]\n-This simplified location approach is only possible if the emitter is located in between the receivers, that is, a three-set of receivers (2D) form a triangle that has the emitter inside it.\n-Different receivers might have different antenna gains and correcting for it will greatly increase accuracy. A quick and dirty way of doing so is positioning the receivers at the same position from a constant power emitter (wifi router, for example) and using the signal strength value difference between them as a calibration factor to be subtracted it from the signals received afterwards.</p>\n",

(you can convert via amazon upload \"convert\" as email subject; or calibre) you can extract your annotations via clippings.txt on kindle paperwhite, or by sharing it around your devices (amazon upload) and export with android kindle app.</li>\n<li>No, using pdf, getting the annotations outside seems to be difficult, you can annotate though, but for me without being able to extract them, this is a bit sensless (there are also no normal pdf annotations, like you know from adobe reader). As PDFs are the onle way for some documents (magzines, math formulars?) this is annoying. Any solution is appreciated! </li>\n<li>For Amazon bought books just use: read.amazon.com/kp/notebook (or the azw... possibility explained above)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As I'm highly interested in reading PDFs on my kindle paperwhite 3 (the recent one), as I want a perfect reading experience (eInk/no bright display and high resolution) and the kindle paperwhite gives me that. I experimented with my kindle fire and my paperwhite, so far my insights for the kindle paperwhite are (they correspond to todays possibilities, when something changes, feel free to comment):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You <strong>can annotate converted ebooks and pdfs</strong></li>\n<li>The problem is <strong>how to get the annotations outsite of the kindle paperwhite</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There seem to be 3 factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Which <em>software version</em> (kindle) do you have?</li>\n<li>How did you transfer the data to your ebook (by <em>usb</em> or by <em>amazon uploading</em>)?</li>\n<li>Which <em>format</em> do you use (pdf or epub or azw...)?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The software version decides how the notes are stored on the kindle. It seems to be that in earlier version notes where stored in an \"mbp\" file format, which could be read with the right software. But amazon changed that to \"mpb1\" (I don't know, if it is possible to read that). (I tested everything with today's recent kindle version 5.8.10.)</p>\n\n<p>The transfer type decides if your uploaded document (only the document, didn't say anything about annotations yet) is distributed to your devices. It is distributed if you upload it via amazaon (e.g. with send to kindle via email), with USB it is not. </p>\n\n<p>The format decides if your annotations are synced around your devices. This obviously only works, if the document itself is synced (uploaded via amazon). So you need to upload it via amazon and use an kindle compatible book format to share your annotations (pdf won't work).</p>\n\n<p><strong>temp TL;DR:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to just share your document around your devices (not annoations), use amazon uploading.</li>\n<li>If you want additionaly to share the annotations also use amazon uploading but use a compatible file format (not pdf), easiest way is, writing \"Convert\" as the subject when sending the file via email uploading.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Sadly</em>: <a href=\"https://read.amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://read.amazon.com</a> and also <a href=\"https://read.amazon.com/kp/notebook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://read.amazon.com/kp/notebook</a>? (shows your annotations in the browser) won't work with that methods (also the windows kindle application!). They just work with amazon bought books, as I see it.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this is very unsatisfactory as I don't just want to have the notes on the kindle reader app or on my kindle paper white, I want it to be on my pc! Reading app for pc would only be second best option, but as I said, it doesn't work like i said in the paragraph before. </p>\n\n<p>So I experimented further. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>paperwhite usb to pc: There are many formats, somebody may try to open these: .apnx, azw3f, azw3r, mbp1, mbs, pds, pdt. <em>I didn't really, would be great if somebody finds out something</em>.</li>\n<li>open the clippings.txt under documents. <strong>There you can find the annotations of kindle books formats (azw... and so on, but not pdf)</strong> (can also be synced files), </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sharing the notations via kindle itself:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The sharing options on paperwhite are shit, you can only share a single annotation at a time, and you can share it with facebook and twitter - facepalm.</li>\n<li><strong>The sharing options with the android fire kindle app are good and much better</strong>. But this only works with formats like azw..., it does not work for pdfs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The pdf annotation extraction/export seems to be difficult. This is very unsatisfactory for me, as some documents (math formulars?) and magazines can only be read properly as an pdf. I appreciate any solution in this area!</p>\n",

What you call \"offline viewing\" is really the only way to read ebooks on these devices.</p>\n\n<p>Epub books are basically a particular type of a <code>.zip</code> file; its contents are made of many different html files, there are no single \"pages\" with the same meaning of a paper book. </p>\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, if there were problems during the download that corrupted the file, you should not be able to open it with your ereading software at all, or get some errors. On the other hand, if you can correctly open it and read its contents, you can be reasonably sure that the file integrity is all right.</p>\n\n<p>Another test that you can easily perform, is to simply browse your ebook and directly see if all of its parts are displaying correctly; a properly created ebook has a table of contents where you can check, .i.e., the supposed number of chapters, and try to navigate to each one of them to see if it is available/accessible. Easy as it sounds, a quick check like this is maybe the best way to check if the file is not damaged: if everything seems all right, well, everything is all right.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, you should also consider that usually, I dare say on the 99% of the cases, an ebook file size is just a couple of megabytes or so. It is very unlikely that with this really small size and consequently short download times, there could be such problems on the network that could damage your file; even in the worst of the hypothesis, redownloading the ebook is just a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Summarizing, your concerns are perfectly understandable, but in a real world scenario, they are likely to happen in the 0,01% range, maybe.</p>\n",

(I never heard of it). </p>\n\n<p>The content creation environment is in closed beta, so I wouldn't expect there to be any way to access the source code. </p>\n\n<p>But the reading portal lets you view the full HTML which is generated by the HTMLBook source. I'm guessing that they have a tool to import asciidoc into HTMLbook, but I'm not sure if it only imports a subset of ASCIIDOC elements. </p>\n\n<p>I think the whole point of Atlas is to make it unnecessary to have access to the source code, and to provide readymade templates and styles. Building for epub, pdf and mobi is complex, and it would be hard to recreate their toolchain on your own production environment. </p>\n\n<p>Based on the video I've seen, it looks very impressive and hopefully will be a single source competitor to Adobe Indesign. It's unclear whether storing the source on the cloud will allow you to download an offline copy of the source.</p>\n\n<p>I'm struck by the similarities between Docbook XML and the elements created through the editor. (Indeed, I suspect HTMLBook is based upon it). Even if you downloaded an offline copy on source, I'm unsure how you would build it yourself; (for example, it seems that Atlas uses a commercial  PDF processor from AntennaHouse, which most people wouldn't have a license for).</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear though. If you have access to the HTML output, you could probably import it into some desktop ebook creation tool and change the styles as necessary. The generated HTML is very clean, so I would expect it not to be that painful. </p>\n\n<p>One example of a down-and-dirty export is to paste the HTML output into a MS Word doc, make sure the images are all there and then convert it into a PDF. </p>\n",

If needed, make your additions to the links in this file. ( I am assuming this file is the parent to all links.

It shouldn't matter where the page breaks are, the text should flow to the end of a page, then the illustration, and then the text resumes.

There is no physical object to be damaged during the reading process.  There is, in fact, nothing at all to tell the retailer that the book has or has not been read.  I'm sure the issue has been discussed many times by many people.</p>\n\n<p>But this begs the question, is it time to do away with returns?  If a reasonable sample of an ebook is available on a website, along with the traditional marketing collateral, what justification is there to permit a return?  (I am assuming that even in the case of a gift purchase, the reader can evaluate the book before using the gift code, and therefore choose to redeem the code for credit rather than an unwanted book.)</p>\n\n<p>Should I permit returns, or should I not permit returns?</p>\n",

In other words, if you run it through this validator, it will give you zero errors. <a href=\"http://validator.idpf.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://validator.idpf.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>Then from epub, you can use Kindle Beta Previewer to convert to a kindle file. </p>\n\n<p>An epub file is basically a zip file of various HTML files and package.opf. The package.opf will list the TOC so it's virtually a given that if you have a valid epub file, you will have a correctly formatted TOC menu. </p>\n\n<p>If you are using content as a marketing device, I would be fine with keeping it in PDF form. Many people who read things have tablets which allow them to see PDF in its native format. EPUBs are better for content-heavy stuff and for viewing on multiple devices of different sizes. </p>\n\n<p>I don't use the Adobe Indesign --> epub method, but if you are already comfortable with Adobe tools, this might be your best bet because they let you export to epub. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously there's a lot more to say, but this information should give you enough to get started. </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The question seems to ask specifically about how to create a beautiful ebook.  That's hard to answer directly, but I can say that PDFs created via Adobe offer lots of options for font and pixel-perfect layout and illustrations that you're unlikely to find in an epub -- even on a robust reading system. You could argue that epub follows the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">responsive design paradigm</a>, which means the end goal is to have a consistent reading experience on multiple platforms, whereas Adobe tools and workflow are more dedicated to one single form factor. I don't think I'm really being too controversial in saying that Adobe tools can produce lovely and complex designs and layouts, and it would take at least a decade before epub reading systems catch up. On the other hand, epub files are more functional and flexible and less dependent on having the right reading system to read it on. I have seen some amazing things produced for iBooks, but these are optimized only for one platform and not easily read on other platforms. </p>\n\n<p>The question boils down to: do the benefits of designing for a single reading system outweigh the benefits of responsive design?  </p>\n",

However, it is quite legal\nto buy a book on one continent and to carry it with you when you move\nor travel to another continent, even when it cannot be legally sold on this other continent. When the book is a hard copy, or a\nDRM-free ebook, this raises no problem, and you are free to read the book anywhere</p>\n\n<p>My question is: what happen when the book is shackled in DRM?

The fact that your pdf is an image file makes no difference. Keep in mind that if your book is in manuscript format you will have to do a bit of tweaking if you want it printed in common stock book sizes. But if you have an a4-size manuscript and you're satisfied with an a4-sized book, you will have no problem. </p>\n\n<p>The text you are interested in can be downloaded in pdf format. Download that file, then use Adobe Reader (free) to get the width and height of the book. When you start a private print project with Lulu, you will be asked if you want to make the file available in the Lulu bookstore. Since you just want a copy for yourself, answer \"no.\" You will be given a choice of standard print sizes. If there is a match between the file dimensions as reflected in Adobe Reader and the print sizes offered by Lulu, you are in luck. Upload the file and you will be asked to submit or create a cover. Lulu's cover creator takes care of this process for you. Input the title and author. If you are so moved to upload a graphic, remember that it should be 300 dpi in the CMYK colorspace. Otherwise, choose one of the preformatted cover designs. </p>\n\n<p>If the size of your book does not match, or if you want to squeeze the size up or down to match a stock size, use a program like jpdftweak (free) to change the file dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>After the cover is created, you can place an order for the printed book. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I have an old 2009 Kindle 4 with its low resolution screen. I work in academia so I read books, articles and technical documents in PDF format on a daily basis. I once tried to use my old Kindle for that but it caused more pain than it helped because the screen is too small, the resolution is too low and it is rather slow for zooming in and out. </p>\n\n<p>I literally waited years for Amazon to release a bigger screen version (8\" or more) of a Kindle but it seems that I could just die waiting for that to happen. Therefore I am in the hunt for something better than my 6\" Kindle mainly for PDF purposes and the occasional MOBI/EPUB book. I considered the following options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Sony DPT-RP1 would of course be anyone's first choice for such a purpose but I work under Linux and an old version of Mac OS X and the device is incompatible with these two systems. I also find the price to be a little exaggerated for what it really does (<em>exclusively</em> for PDF files). </p></li>\n<li><p>The reMarkable 10\" tablet seems promising but then there is that price tag on par with the Sony. What is more, I am really just interested in being able to <em>read</em> my books; I really do not need to be able to download and install new apps or take fancy handwritten notes. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Kobo Aura One with its 7.8\" screen has very good resolution. I want to believe that it might just be enough for my purposes on landscape mode. But I read reviews on how poorly it handles PDF files. Then I read about koReader OS which apparently handles PDF files much better than its original OS. </p></li>\n<li><p>I also just read about the new 7 inch version of the Kindle Oasis. The screen is a little smaller than the Kobo Aura One's. But then I would tend to trust Kindle's OS a lot more because it has proven to be reliable. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is the Kobo Aura One a good ebook reader for PDF files (under koReader)? Does the new 7\" Kindle outperforms it? Or is there a better option on that price range (250 ± 50 USD)?</p>\n",

Or that your desktop tool is not processing everything properly. (I suspect you are using Adobe InDesign?)</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to know where to start. But when I do projects (and I don't use a desktop tool like Indesign), I generate the .opf automatically and that file never gives validation issues.  Most people never have to touch this file when creating epubs. </p>\n\n<p>My recommendation for continuing would be to start a new project and then add one chapter/HTML file at a time and then validate that before continuing. Once you feel confident that your tool is producing valid content, you should add additional chapters. </p>\n\n<p>I was inclined to share with you one of my valid opf files to compare against, but you can find clean opf files from many places on the web. Once you validate again with the ? mark, you will see that the opf errors are just scratching the surface here. Perhaps you should consider trying another tool (like Sigil or Calibre) and importing your content into a brand new project inside the new tool? </p>\n\n<p>Another thing. I notice that some of the image references go to an external source. Generally the images should be included in the zip and listed in the  manifest. </p>\n\n<p>There are many ways to produce a epub file, but the key thing is to use a tool or develop a process that you are confident is  valid right from the start. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> This depends on what you mean by DRM, but generally the answer is no.</p>\n\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n\n<p>DRM can mean a lot of things, but it's basically a combination of software, file formats, and, in somewhat rare cases, the hardware itself. Unless the hardware <em>and the software</em> have some way to figure out where you are, they can't do anything differently based on your location.</p>\n\n<p>So, unless your reader is checking its IP address against a geolocation service, using a GPS device built into the hardware, or doing something very similar to one of these techniques, it has no way of knowing where you are. All of these techniques have problems, and all tend to lead to bad user experience. </p>\n\n<p>There are circumstances where this kind of DRM <em>might</em> make sense. For example, an intelligence agency might create its own software, file format, and region-based DRM to prevent people from accessing certain files outside of certain locations. (This is probably not the best idea, for various reasons, but it could be done.) But a mass-market maker of consumer devices might consider this a likely PR and customer-relations disaster-in-the-making, so you would expect them to avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth pointing out that you could avoid such DRM by simply turning off internet for your device or putting it in airplane mode. If it <em>still</em> detected its location and disabled a book you had purchased, you would then know it was secretly transmitting, despite you telling it not to do so. This is the kind of thing that doesn't typically go over well when it hits the press, so it's unlikely anyone would try it.</p>\n\n<h1>A Side Note about DVDs and Region-Based DRM</h1>\n\n<p>DVDs famously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_region_code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">use a region-based DRM scheme</a>, in which every DVD player and every DVD has one or more codes. Each code corresponds to a region of the world. Unless the DVD and the player have at least one code in common, the player will refuse to play the DVD. But here's the critical thing: those codes are hard-coded in the discs. Most devices allow you to change it, but only a small number of times (like 7). And neither the disc nor the device will automatically change its code when you move them. So, even this DRM scheme is not an automatic one like you're asking about. It's also worth pointing out that the market for bootlegged movies is generally <em>much</em> bigger than the market for even the best-selling books. The economic analysis is very different.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>I have never heard of a DRM for ebooks that varies by geography automatically. That does not mean it doesn't exist, but I'd be surprised if any publicly-available readers did use such a technology.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I've used the Kindle app on my android for years now and decided to purchase a Kindle Whitepaper device just to try it out and I must say, I was very disappointed. First of all, it is a nice looking device and the size and weight is both comfortable to hold and read, but that's where the positive comments end. Maybe I'm just used to the app, but I found the devise clunky and slow and not very flexible. The android app has a lot more features you won't find on the device, like page transitions. On the app there is a turn the page feature that looks just like it says. Or you can scroll from page to page or just pop from page to page. On the device, it is an ugly, pixelated dissolve from page to page. The letters are not true black, but grayish. You cannot change the font type or page color (not that I could find). You have to pay to not see ads, no speakers for listening to audio books and so on. Just so many negatives that I returned mine within a week of trying to get used to it. I will stick with my smaller screen and enjoy a far superior app.  </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I was impatient so I went ahead with the procedure. (Although worried about bricking a new device, I got it mainly to read PDFs and therefore really wanted to have KOReader up and running).</p>\n\n<p>So I will sum up here the procedure for <em>first-time installation of KOReader on fresh new Kobo Aura ONE</em>.\nNote that this is just the procedure that I followed, it might change in future or not work for you. Off course, I provide <strong>no guarantees about accuracy of this guide. Please read the information in the below links for most up to date information.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Prepare your device. Make sure your device is working properly with no errors. It's recommended to <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/6032/updating-your-kobo-ereader\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">update to the latest firmware version</a>. Charge the battery full and switch off WiFi.</p></li>\n<li><p>A prerequisite for installing alternative readers is the installation of <em>Kobo Start Menu</em> (KSM). The detailed instructions and the most up-to-date archive can be found <a href=\"https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3195117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Download it and follow the instructions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>connect the Kobo to the PC</li>\n  <li>copy the folder <code>kbmenupngs</code> to the root of the device (e.g. <code>K:\\</code>)</li>\n  <li>eject safely and disconnect</li>\n  <li>check that all images (<code>exit_nickel.png</code>, <code>switchtokoreader.png</code>, etc.) are listed in the library and their thumbnails are displayed there, and at least once as tiles on the home screen. Only then proceed to step two.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>connect the Kobo device to the PC</li>\n  <li>copy <code>KoboRoot.tgz</code> to the folder <code>.kobo</code> of the device</li>\n  <li>eject safely and disconnect</li>\n  <li>wait until the update is finished (do not interrupt it, even if it takes some time)</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note 1: You can always return to the default Kobo reader by starting the Nickel reader (press <code>start nickel</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Note 2: KSM is by default only launched every second time but if everything is working correctly for you, you can set it to be the default:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>KSM is by default configured to run only after every second reboot, and nickel automatically runs after every other second reboot. This is a kind of security measure in case KSM does not properly run after installation (something that cannot be excluded with future firmwares or changed hardware). After KSM has started the first time, please change this behaviour:</p>\n  \n  <p>Select <code>tools</code> > <code>activate</code> > <code>set runmenu settings.msh</code> > <code>always</code></p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>The KSM should now be installed and working. But for Aura ONE (and some other newer devices) we need to apply also a patch. You can find the archive and instructions <a href=\"https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3389190\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Follow the instructions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>extract the <code>KoboRoot.tgz</code> from archive uploaded to this post</li>\n  <li>copy the extracted <code>KoboRoot.tgz</code> into <code>.kobo</code> of your device (If you cannot connect to the pc from within KSM, connect from within nickel.)</li>\n  <li>safely eject and disconnect your device</li>\n  <li>select (in KSM home) <code>handle update</code> > <code>install update</code> (do not select <code>install partial update</code>)</li>\n  <li>wait until the device has rebooted</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the patch, you should notice that the KSM font is slightly larger (at least on the bigger Aura ONE).</p></li>\n<li><p>Now that KSM is up and running, you can install any compatible readers and utilities. This is relatively simple. Download the latest (or a version of your choice) nightly build from<br>\n<a href=\"http://build.koreader.rocks/download/nightly/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>http://build.koreader.rocks/download/nightly/</code></a><br>\nExtract the archive and copy the folder <code>koreader</code> to the <code>.adds</code> directory of your connected device. Safely eject the device and press <code>start koreader</code> to launch KOReader.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>That is all. I haven't encountered any problems and the process was quite simple, after I gathered all the information (which was the hardest part).</p>\n\n<p><em>On a sidenote: After brief testing, KOReader is definitely superior to the default reader for reading PDFs, thanks to its adaptive zooming (cropping) of whitespace. This makes even A4 documents readable. So if PDFs make big part of your reading, I definitely recommend it. For EPUB ebooks, I might keep using the original reader (a subjective choice) but thanks to the KSM, it is relatively simple to switch between the two readers.</em></p>\n\n<p>The main information sources I followed were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://(https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Installation-on-Kobo-devices#newer-model)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">KOReader Wiki: Installation on Kobo devices - Aura One, Aura Edition 2</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3195117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tshering's post at MobileRead Forums about installing Kobo Start Menu (KSM)</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3389190\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tshering's post on MobileRead Forums about updating KSM for newer Kobo devices</a>, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2841893\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ken Maltby's post on MobileRead Forums about whole procedure to install KOReader</a> (and other utilities)</li>\n</ul>\n",

LI? etc)  and just let the reading system (and the reader) do it. Or maybe specify a default for body text? For one thing, this becomes less of an issue when displays are wider and reading systems become more powerful. You don't want your publisher css to depend on the user turning justification on or off.  If the user perceives that justification is impeding the ability to read the text, they can usually turn it off on settings. Handling of justification on reading systems will only improve over time. </p>\n\n<p>I'd be curious what screen dimensions this issue is happening in.

It will bring up a notification telling me that the application is not responding and if I would like to wait for it to respond. If I hit wait, it will just continue to freeze up and an every 15 seconds it will bring the prompt again until it inevitably freezes and crashes. </p>\n\n<p>I did when selecting either American English or British English.

I am saying fortunately, because it does leave open the one proper option, which is to describe in general terms some current disseminations and pricing practices, which structure the ebook market.\nThese should be hints as to how to search on your own the current market for sources of free book.

And there is the\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/internetarchivebooks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Internet Archive own repository</a>. But these books may be in\nawkward formats, or poorly digitalized ... the technical quality is\nvery variable.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But since the above sources are making available public domain books, they are   unlikely to contain recent books.</p>\n\n<p>Many independent authors give some of their ebooks for free, though\nyou seldom get complete series (but it does happen). They will often\nask you to subscribe to their mailing list in exchange for the free\nbook(s). And some of these mails will contain information about other\nfree resources. See <a href=\"https://bookfunnel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BookFunnel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instafreebie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Instafreebie</a>. Many author will give you books for free, in exchange for honest independent reviews on various sites. You may also get pre-release versions (ARCs, i.e., advance review copy) in exchange for reviewing or proof-reading the book.</p>\n\n<p>Most retailers (including <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kobo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Smashwords</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amazon</a>) have a lot of\nbooks available for free, sometimes permanently, sometimes only for 2\nor 3 days. Grab what you want, as it may be gone tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>You can subscribe to various daily mails that will keep you informed\nof such opportunities. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.bookbub.com/launch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BookBub</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thefussylibrarian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Fussy Librarian</a>,\n<a href=\"https://mybookcave.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book Cave</a> , <a href=\"http://robinreads.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Robin Reads</a>, <a href=\"http://bookbarbarian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BookBarbarian</a> and many others.  Some mailing\nlists may specialise on topic, publisher or retailer. Just subscribe\nto some.</p>\n\n<p>Some publishers give away free books to people who are subscribed to\ntheir mailing list. Some of them are quite good, though they are often\nthe first volume of a series. For example, the publisher <a href=\"http://www.phoenixpick.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arc Manor (aka Phoenix Pick)</a> specialises in science\nfiction, and has one book for free every month.</p>\n\n<p>Many books can be bought for very low prices, such as $1 or $2,\nincluding award winners and classics.</p>\n\n<p>A good source can also be to buy book bundles. <a href=\"http://humblebundle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Humble Bundles</a> has some\ngreat opportunities in all kinds of books (including comics). You can\ntypically get a bundle of 25 books of good average quality (including\nsome top ones) for $15. You may also want to look at <a href=\"https://storybundle.com/sorcery\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">StoryBundle</a>\nbundles, though they are less varied, and a bit more expensive. Besides these two bundling retailers, you can sometimes get bundles from publishers or retailers.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot more to be said and found, but this ought to get you\nstarted. My information is probably biased by the kind of books I am\ninterested in.</p>\n\n<p>But it is also important to help by paying when you can. Most of these books\nhave to be produced and edited by people who try to make a living.</p>\n",

I <strong>extracted all the important text parts</strong> of these links and attached these to this post.</p>\n\n<p>My own <em>conclusion</em> is this: <strong>Using a lcd display does not make an eye strain difference</strong> / is not better than eink/epaper <strong>if</strong> you're using a ...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>appropriate <strong>brightness</strong>: Many people use too bright displays. For correct configuration you can do this: Make this monitor as bright as possible and then reduce the brightness and while you do that always switch looks beside the monitor and notice if you percieve the monitor as a light source. If you don't find your monitor a light source, you got the correct brightness (notice: because of ambient light changes [e.g. day, night] your monitor brightess must be adjusted respectively for perfect monnitor brightness). On the other side, when you're using a monitor/ tablet display with high ambient light (e.g. outside) it is important your display supports high enough brightness (e.g. high cd/m²), to also adjust to that ambient light. E.g. 500-600 cd/m² is no problem for new tablet displays (btw. sometimes just rotating your tablet in some direction has the effect, that you don't have to have a very, very high brightness [so e.g. don't hold it directly in the light]).</li>\n<li>appropriate <strong>anti-glare</strong>: Because many product developers want \"brilliant\" screens the often use glare displays. The problem with this is, that you will have reflections on that which can cause eye strain. Many try ti circumvent that by using a too high brightness. The in my opion much better way is to use an anti-glare display or if you already got an glare display, you can buy a screen display protector film which is anti glare. (btw. the kindle paperwhite also uses an anti glare display)</li>\n<li><strong>continous backlight</strong> (no flicker): Some monitors (and also some tablet displays) adjust the brightness using PWM. This means to give the impression of lower light they don't just turn the light volume lower but the use full light volume and then just turn the screen black for a short time period. This isn't good for the eyes and can also be audible on low light cause of a high pitched tone. So before buying a monitor / tablet, make sure that it uses continious backlight. Btw. LCD pixel itself do not flicker or something if you have still image. They just make the transition from one state to the other (and with too much \"overdrive\" you can have short white flashes while transitioning [short higher voltage for faster transition, configureable in many monitores], so turn off overdrive or use it small). But when you have a still image (while reading), there is nothing to change and the still image will just continously be displays (no flicker or something).</li>\n<li>appropriate <strong>light color</strong>: When you are reading a real book / eink (turned off light) you don't have as much blue light as often people have on an backlit lcd screen. You can adjust that on your lcd using e.g. f.lux (windows) or twilight (android - but better are apps using root rights cause dark colors then can be changed more appropriately).</li>\n<li>appropriate <strong>resolution</strong>: On an backlit lcd screen you have pixels which are often blurred/grainy cause of to small resolution. E.g. on a 27 inch display with fullHD you get arount 80 ppi. A kindle paperwhite has 300 ppi. So get an 4k display, if you can: This will get you around 160 ppi which is still less, but keep in mind that your distance is also doubled in comparison to the distance you have to a kindle paperwhite while reading (so this is pretty nice resolution), Also when you buy an tablet you can easily get tablets with around 250 ppi.</li>\n<li>appropriate <strong>angle independence</strong>: There are some monitors which are highly dependent on view angle. So it can happen that your two eyes don't see just two differnece perspectives but also difference colors and so on. But at todays monitors with even TN-Panels it should be no problem. And on IPS-Panels that's no problem anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Here an intuitive metapher why lcd displays fullfilling the above points do not differ from eink in terms of eye strain</strong>: When your eink device gets sunlight on it, it reflects them to your eye. But suppose you could build a display (we call now \"D.\") that you emit exactly the same light that yould normally reflect your eink device. Light is light, so that would be exactly the same for you, you couldn't say that it is reflected or emitted light. But now look on your lcd display fullfilling the above points (we call it \"L.\"). Oh, L. already equals D. (fullfilling above points), so it also equals the eink display <strong>:)</strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Extracted google search</strong>   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/181577/e-ink-vs.-lcd-which-screen-is-best-for-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.howtogeek.com/181577/e-ink-vs.-lcd-which-screen-is-best-for-reading/</a> (refering to a study)\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"The key here is that the LCD screen has to be a high resolution, which modern tablet LCD screens are.\"</li>\n<li>\"Bear in mind that this doesn’t account for glare — if they replicated this test with participants trying to read in direct sunlight, there would be much more eye strain required for the LCD screens.\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/5934993/is-e-ink-really-better-for-my-eyes-than-my-ipad\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lifehacker.com/5934993/is-e-ink-really-better-for-my-eyes-than-my-ipad</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Today's screens are definitely less tiring to look at than older displays, which refreshed the image much less frequently, causing a flicker.

Furthermore, the company is also using a high-resolution next-generation panel from LG that's backlit with LED.\"</li>\n<li>\"A backlit or nonbacklit display doesn't make a difference, Hornfeld says. And if you're reading a bright screen in the dark, your eyes will adjust. Your pupil gets large in the dark, so when you turn on a brightly lit display, it may bother your eyes at first, but they'll compensate. It's like when you wake up in the morning, open the shades, and are blinded by the light at first. But then you get used to it.\"</li>\n<li>\"Hornfeld notes that when you read or watch a movie, you simply don't blink as much, so you're eyes can get dry--especially if you're already prone to having an underlying dry-eye problem. (A New York Times article earlier this year also made a similar point about not enough moisture because of lack of blinking. It also offers some reading tactics to reduce the potential for eyestrain).\"</li>\n<li>\"Hornfeld says that today's LCD screens aren't going to give you eyestrain. That said, some people simply like the way e-ink appears on the page, and some prefer how the iPad displays text. It's an aesthetic issue more than anything else. In other words, you can simply be averse to one screen or another--but that doesn't mean it will give you eyestrain.\"</li>\n<li>\"I haven't noted any difference in eyestrain from when I read on the iPad or when I read on the Kindle or Nook for long periods. Yes, the battery life is worse on an LCD device like the Nook Color than an e-ink Nook Wi-Fi or 3G. But my eyes feel about the same regardless of whether I'm using an iPad or the Kindle. The delayed flash of a e-ink page turn and sometimes ghosting of letters or images on e-ink e-readers didn't bother me as much as it does some people I know, though the latest generation e-ink readers (Kindle, Sony) have a new \"Pearl\" screen that helps remedy these little, nagging flaws.\"</li>\n<li>\"Sure, I much prefer using an e-ink device outdoors in sunlight. Given the choice indoors, I don't have a real preference; they both look pretty good to me, and I even don't mind reading on my iPhone 3GS or iPod Touch 4G (the Retina Display seems quite good for reading, I just wish it was on my iPad). \"</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2012/10/02/new-study-suggests-e-ink-is-not-better-for-your-eyes-than-lcds/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://the-digital-reader.com/2012/10/02/new-study-suggests-e-ink-is-not-better-for-your-eyes-than-lcds/</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"The objective tests resulted in a mix data points, with some subjects scoring higher after reading on E-ink and others scoring higher after reading on LCD. The results from the visual fatigue query were fairly close, though the LCD did rate marginally higher. Even the reading speed was virtually identical. In fact, the only major difference was when the test subjects were queried about general fatigue. LCD test subjects reported a higher general fatigue level than did E-ink test subjects, but that could be due to the size and weight of the iPad.\nE-ink is often described as being just like reading on paper, and that's why the scientists were surprised to discover that the results were so similar. They were also somewhat surprised because this study contradicted many of the studies listed in the bibliography. It has long been documented that reading on screens is more tiring than reading on paper, and the bibliography cites any number of papers from the past 30 years which prove this is true.\nSo yes, all those assumptions about reading on screens being bad for you had a basis in fact.  But here's the catch: many of those older papers might not be relevant to how we read in 2012. As the authors point out in the paper, screen technology has improved a lot in the past decade, even more so in the past few years.\nWhat if the reason this study couldn't find a difference in was that the subjects read on an iPad? Even today, that is a high quality screen. What if the subjects in those older studies were affected more by the poor quality of the tech than the tech itself?\nIf this pans out then it means the screen fetishists were right all along. A higher resolution screen really is better, and each step up in resolution is a boost in the user experience.

Although it can offer an excellent reading experience in bright sunlight, the screens can become uncomfortable to use in dark settings because of the lack of contrast and backlighting on the screen.\"</li>\n<li>\"LCD screens, meanwhile, have long struggled to offer good viewing angles for reading. Apple’s latest IPS LCD screens include extremely wide viewing angles, but the reflective glass on the screen could be a hindrance in brightly lit situations.\"</li>\n<li>\"Professor Alan Hedge, director of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at Cornell University, said that reducing eye fatigue is less a matter of choosing a specific display than of taking short breaks from looking at the screen.\nWhen we read, Dr. Hedge explained,  a series of ocular muscles jump around and can cause strain, regardless of whether we are looking at pixels or paper. “While you’re reading, your eyes make about 10,000 movements an hour. It’s important to take a step back every 20 minutes and let your eyes rest,” he said.\nToday’s screens are definitely less tiring to look at than older displays, which refreshed the image much less frequently, causing a flicker.

As with any reflective surface, the more ambient light, the brighter the display looks. This attribute mimics traditional ink and paper, and users of E Ink displays have said that they do not have the same eye fatigue as with LCDs when reading for long periods of time.\"</li>\n<li>\"There have been a few studies that are worth taking a look at, that talk about the benefits of e-paper vs the traditional LCD experience.

One is the backlighting which is either supplied by CFL flourescent bulbs or recently the much brighter LED backlighting. The second is the screen refresh rate of the LCD display.

With the iPad, I was only able to go for about 45 minutes using varied brightness settings on both iBooks and Kindle for iPad.\nOn April 20, Sandi fared slightly better on the living room couch,  citing about an hour of total tolerance to eyestrain on the iPad while adjusting various settings for text size and brightness level. Additionally, Sandra felt she would be able to read for at least 2 hours using her Kindle 2 under this lighting condition.\"</li>\n<li>\"The iPad appears to be adequate for light daytime indoor reading, but fails miserably as an outdoor reading device. Vizplex e-Ink readers such as the Kindle, the SONY line and the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook still appear to be much more optimal for long duration reading indoors and outdoors during daytime hours.\nHowever, both Sandi and I were very surprised how well the iPad performs in dimly lit rooms and in complete darkness. If it weren't for the considerable heft of the iPad, she would strongly consider using one to replace her Kindle for reading in bed at night, citing less chance for disruption of her spouse and less eyestrain than using a Mighty Brite or similar LED clip lamp with the Vizplex display on the Kindle.\nWe were both at somewhat of a toss up if White on Black or Black on White was the preferred color scheme for night time reading, but agreed that the Kindle reader application was superior to iBooks overall for serious readers in any light condition.\"</li>\n<li>\"For my own personal use I find White on Black to be much more acceptable to me for use during the evening in dim light or dark rooms, and it also drastically reduces the amount of white light coming out of the iPad, so it is far less likely to disturb my spouse.\nHowever, Sandi had the opposite reaction, feeling that the White on Black text caused an unacceptable amount of eyestrain. Instead, she was able to adjust the settings in iBooks using regular Black on White to approximately 10 to 15 percent brightness which produced strain-free illumination that she could read with comfortably for several hours.\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083676#s3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083676#s3</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Discussion\nThe aim of the present study was to compare prolonged reading on three different supports regarding their effects on visual fatigue. Likewise Kang et al. [17], and Chang et al. [19], variables such as font size, typeface and number of words per page were not manipulated and were kept constant across the three devices for the entire reading sessions. Subjective measures (VFS) suggested that prolonged reading on the LCD (Kindle Fire HD) triggers higher visual fatigue with respect to the E-ink (Kindle Paperwhite) and the paper book. Concerning objective measures (BPS and CFF), contrasting results were found.\nAs to CFF, results revealed a significant drop in sensory perception after reading independently from the device, thus failing to show significant differences among the three reading supports. On the one hand, these results are in line with previous studies employing the CFF for similar purposes, which did not succeed in finding differences between paper book, E-ink and LCD [11] and between E-ink and LCD [18]. On the other hand, although our experimental plan has some similarities with that of Kang et al. [17], where the task consisted of reading novelettes for 40 to 60 min, our results are contrasting. These authors found a significant difference between the paper book and the LCD, namely a larger CFF reduction when reading on the LCD. In the present study, we could not replicate this finding.\nWith regard to BPS, experimental evidence indicated that reading on the LCD leads to a larger decrease in the number of blinks, with respect to the other supports. This result is in line with a large number of studies on CVS (for a review see [32]), where the use of backlit displays is usually associated with a decreased frequency of blinking and an increased rate of tear evaporation, each of which contributes to dry eyes. In fact, prolonged display exposure contributes to incomplete blinking provoking tear film instability [44], which is one of the main factors for visual fatigue on VDT [45].\nIn contrast with previous studies, where no differences in terms of perceived visual fatigue (VFS) were found between LCD, E-ink and paper book [2] and LCD and E-ink [18], our results showed that participants felt visually fatigued only when reading on the LCD. Such a finding might be attributable to the longer reading sessions employed in our study (on average 73 min, SD 10 min), with respect to previous studies [11], [18].\nFinally, results on Subjective preference suggest that participants with no experience with e-readers prefer paper books. The overall belief that digital reading media reduce the pleasure of reading could be cultural rather than cognitive [46]. Moreover, since reading habit for paper books is normally fixed in childhood [17], it’s quite obvious that people prefer paper books rather than e-books.\nIn conclusion, our results might be imputable to the higher level of luminance emitted by the LCD (see Materials and Methods). With respect to the paper book and the E-ink, reading on the LCD reduces the size of the pupil (APS) and the frequency of eye blink (BPS), and increases the perceived visual fatigue (VFS).\nAlthough the Kindle Fire HD adopts a last generation LCD with IPS (in-plane switching) technology, advanced polarizing filter, and anti-glare technology, the issues related to backlight technology are still present. In contrast to LCD-displays, which have been associated with impaired reading performance [14] and higher visual fatigue [17], results on E-ink displays are encouraging.\nSince visual discomfort and related symptoms occurring in VDT workers have been recognized as a growing health problem [32], we believe that the growing spread of e-readers should be taken into account as well. Although the aim of this study was to make an up-to-date comparison of reading devices concerning their effects on visual fatigue, it should be emphasized that comparisons with previous studies, employing older display technologies, have some limits. The use of reading devices as independent variables clearly leads to device-dependent results.\nFuture studies will include the manipulation of the length of the reading sessions, the luminance levels of the displays, and the study of binocular vision on prolonged reading [47].\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.marvell.com.cn/application-processors/armada-100/assets/Marvell-eReader-White-Paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.marvell.com.cn/application-processors/armada-100/assets/Marvell-eReader-White-Paper.pdf</a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Despite the advances in display technology, as the computer and consumer electronics worlds go digital, human beings still have a human body that responds to analog—from the sound waves we hear to the color and lights we see. So despite CRT, TFT, LCD, plasma, or other display technologies, humans still find it easier to read off of paper.That is why e-paper, digital ink and eReaders were created--to reduce the eye strain inherent in back-lit or other display technologies. In fact, digital paper works nearly opposite the standard computer screen display. First, it looks more like paper and uses actual pigments. It is not backlit or refreshed. You can read an eReader outdoors or in direct sunlight, unlike a backlit display, which loses all of its readability in direct sunlight.\"</li>\n<li>\"E-ink does not need to be refreshed like backlit technology.

I have two enhanced ebook files for this book; an .epub and a .mobi. I've tried using them with Kindle, Kobo and iBooks. I've tried them through Google Play. I've tried them on my macbook pro, iPhone, iPad, and a PC but and nothing works. The place where the audio file is looks like a rectangular bar with a 'play' triangle symbol but when I click it nothing happens. Can anyone please offer some advice for this problem?
