That effectively removes the book from normal searches. We can't figure out what triggers the \"red flag\" and Amazon isn't saying. The cover art doesn't seem to be any better, worse, more suggestive, whatever. Covers are definitely tamer than directly competitive books. Nothing stands out for us in the book content. It's a case of \"If A, B, and C are fine, why did D get flagged?\"</p>\n\n<p>For anyone else who has encountered this phenomenon, have you come up with any insights?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOLLOWS:</p>\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, you can only see the ADULT tag via Amazon's API. You won't see it on the book's listing on Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>To see an example, search amazon for the author \"Blake Cross\". (The results are Not Suitable for Work!) I have no relationship to that author or what's published!</p>\n\n<p>To see the \"ADULT\" tag exposed via Amazon's API, go to <a href=\"http://www.salesrankexpress.com/\">http://www.salesrankexpress.com/</a> and enter Blake Cross as the author name. </p>\n\n<p>The author/maintainer of Sales Rank Express explains his take on the ADULT tag in his FAQ at <a href=\"http://www.salesrankexpress.com/#adult\">http://www.salesrankexpress.com/#adult</a> - in short, he says it appears to be arbitrary and inconsistent. He concludes, \"By contrast, a surprising number of Kindle books are blatantly pornographic without being labeled 'Adult'.\"</p>\n\n<p>Our own specific medium is electronic books (we stopped doing print books), Romance genre. We've concluded pretty much the same thing as the Sales Rank Express maintainer. It seems to be based on the book cover rather than the text content, and rather arbitrary. It seems to be more subtle things such as setting and situation, facial expression, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>To the best of our knowledge, as publisher, there are NO clear guidelines; the publisher is NOT informed when an offering is deemed \"Adult.\"</p>\n\n<p>For something like Blake Cross's offerings, the reason for ADULT designation is obvious. The situation is far more subtle with a Romance-genre novel.</p>\n\n<p>The question remains: For anyone else who has encountered this phenomenon, have you come up with any insights?</p>\n",

(Maybe prefaced with \"From the library of...\" or something like that to make it a little more friendly.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm not trying to hide this from the reader. In fact letting the reader know that sharing their copy of the book is also sharing their name or email address is much of the point of the exercise.</p>\n\n<p>It isn't difficult to merge two PDF documents together, so it would be easy to add the identifying information on a single page, but I'd like it to appear on all (or at least most) pages.</p>\n\n<p>This particular book happens to be generated from a LaTeX document. There are LaTeX packages that can be used to customize the page footer, of course, but I'd prefer a solution that would work for an arbitrary PDF document.  (The LaTex-to-PDF process is relatively slow, and I'd like to be able to do this both on-demand and/or in batches.)</p>\n\n<p>This particular book happens to be distributed as a PDF document, but something similiar for other ebook formats could be useful in the future (both for me, and I suspect, others).</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that a moderately savvy reader can probably remove or overwrite the identifying text, and that this is likely to be even easier to do with formats like epub or mobi.  That's OK.

The trouble is that there are many such tools, all of them seemingly from small shops, and many of them look to be crappy at best and shady at worst.  Can anyone recommend a specific application or approach?  (My ideal solution would be Linux-based, since the rest of my publishing workflow is Linux based, but I'm sure many readers would be happy to see Windows-only recommendations as well.)</p>\n",

Initially I was using an image in the list-style-image property to create a custom bullet.

The text appeared one line below the bullet and a little to the left and not alongside as it should (in Firefox). When I previewed the MOBI created with KindleGen in KindlePreviewer, the image of the bullet was coming out tiny (and not proportional to the image file) and the same problem of the bullet not positioned in the same line as the text. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the bullets appear differently in each of the different kindle models (Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire, etc.), the size of the image varied and with different sort of spacing between the bullet and the text. </p>\n\n<p>I then read somewhere online that Kindle does not support the list-style-image tag. Kindle's official supported CSS tags also do not include it. So I created a simple bulleted list without the CSS but with the same html code above. The problem is the same with the spacing. And different shaped bullets appear on each tier. For example a hollow circular one on the first, a squarish one on the second and so on. </p>\n\n<p>So, my question is , is there a way (any lines of code) to make streamlined bullets in html for kindle's ebook without all these variations in different versions, and also without all these unneeded space insertions, and a proper sort of positioning. Bullets that stay the same no matter which version of kindle is being used. Hope I have explained myself properly. </p>\n",

    "body": "<p>In epub and kindle css, you can specify a fallback font by specifying </p>\n\n<pre><code> p {font-family: \"Georgia\", serif}\n h1 {font-family: \"Helvetica\", sans-serif}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If various reading systems have defaults for serif and sans-serif, can you tell me what they are? </p>\n\n<p>I.E. Kindle e-ink, Kindle android app, Google Play Books, ibooks, Kobo, Adobe DE. </p>\n\n<p>On a related question, can I assume that all titles are in the default sans-serif font? When a customer overrides publisher defaults and chooses a certain font (like Bookerly on kindle), does that leave the title fonts still in the default sans-serif? </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Someone on KDP forum has confirmed that user-selected fonts for kindle systems are the same for body fonts and heading font. Therefore, you would need to specify a heading font if you want it to be different. </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong> I encourage people to post fonts existing on  the mobile devices or reading systems that they have. Please indicate whether there is an option to specify Publisher Defaults on the reading system. Also, if you have any insight as to which font would be considered the default Serif or Sans Serif choice by the reading system, please mention it.  Thanks! </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3 (5/2017)</strong> A commenter has pointed out that some Amazon  Kindle devices are using  fonts for Indic languages written in Bengali/Devanagari/Gujarati/Kannada/Malayalam/Tamil/Telugu. On the device this font is referred to as \n\"Noto Sans.\"  Noto is a multilingual font developed and supported by Google, but Amazon has only used  portions of this Noto   font for  Indian languages.  I have seen no official announcement yet. </p>\n",
